catcher all the way into the <unk> 
@ Phil <unk> coming in from left field, stopped at the water <unk> for a drink. Mike Deegan was standing beside it, facing the 
field. He was <unk> the Anniston catcher <unk> up his pitcher before 
the inning began. @ <unk> your eyes open, <unk> Mike <unk> to the <unk> "You're in for trouble". @ The Anniston <unk> did not reply with words. He simply turned to Mike and smiled. 
This so <unk> Deegan that he spun around and said: "I'll 
get that little <unk> So help me God, I'll get <unk> <unk> said: "Why don't you leave him <unk> your own <unk> business", Mike Deegan <unk> shrugged. He stepped into the <unk> wondering why Deegan 
was always looking for trouble. Maybe the answer was in his eyes. When <unk> smiled his eyes never fit in with his lips.   In the 
last of the sixth inning Mike Deegan got up to bat and hit a fast <unk> over the left <unk> head. By the time the <unk> got his 
hands on the ball Deegan was <unk> third base and heading for home. 
The left <unk> threw and it was a good one. But Mike had no chance 
of being <unk> The Anniston catcher was <unk> home <unk> 
All Deegan had to do was <unk> fall away, but <unk> he <unk> into 
the <unk>   Both fell heavily to the ground.   Only 
Mike got to his feet. He went back to touch home <unk> turned and 
walked to the <unk> without looking back.   The Anniston players 
and their manager ran out on the field. They poured water over their <unk> face. He did not move. Then the manager called for a <unk> The Riverside physician came down to look over the injured <unk> Then, quickly, and a little <unk> the doctor ordered 
a couple of <unk> to carry the catcher into the dressing <unk> Deegan was sitting on the <unk> <unk> When the <unk> 
started to carry the catcher off the field he said: "That <unk> to teach the <unk>   Phil <unk> seated next 
to <unk> got up and moved to the other end of the <unk>   The <unk> manager was coming over to the Riverside <unk> He was 
followed by four of his men. It began to look as if something was going 
to happen. Mike sat <unk> watching the manager come <unk> Eddie 
Lee moved over to Mike <unk> side. No one said a <unk> Anniston manager came right up to the <unk> in front of <unk> 
His face was <unk>   <unk> the manager said, his 
voice pitched low, <unk> "That was a <unk> thing to <unk> God's <unk> Mike said, waving the manager away. <unk> it, will you? Tell your guys not to block the <unk> didn't have to <unk> him".   "That's what <you> <unk>   The Anniston manager looked at Eddie <unk> It 
was a cold and calculated look. He turned and went back across the field 
to his <unk> He called in the pitcher who had been <unk> and 
a big, heavy, <unk> built right <unk> moved out to the mound 
for <unk>   The game started again and in the eighth inning 
Mike Deegan came up to <unk> Everyone in the ball park seemed to be 
standing and <unk>   The first ball the <unk> pitcher threw 
came in for Mike's head. Deegan fell into the <unk> the ball going 
over him. He arose slowly and brushed himself off. He got back 
into the <unk> box and on the next pitch dropped into the dirt <unk> the <unk> somebody yelled from the Anniston <unk>   In the Riverside <unk> Frankie <unk> <unk> whispered 
into <unk> <unk> "There's gonna be a <unk> at those <unk> Charlie <unk> a <unk> said. <unk> looking for trouble".   Mike was slow getting into 
the box this time. When he finally did he had to <unk> his head quickly 
away as the pitch came in.   <unk> he shouted to 
the <unk> "One more and I'm coming out <unk>   "I'll 
be <unk> the pitcher yelled back.   Mike Deegan <unk> the rubber plate with the end of his <unk> He stood <unk> 
in the box, but not very close to the plate now. The pitcher wound 
up and the ball came in straight for Mike's head. Deegan <unk> 
got up, turned and, holding the bat with both hands up against his <unk> began to walk slowly out to the <unk> The pitcher tossed his <unk> away and came towards Mike <unk> They were both walking towards 
each other, <unk>   Riverside and Anniston players rushed 
out on the field. In the next moment, it seemed, the infield was <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> kids and a dog. There was 
much shouting and <unk> <unk> sprang up and were quickly <unk> 
Mike and the Anniston pitcher were pulled away before they even 
came together.   Phil <unk> and two other Riverside players 
did not go out on the field when the fighting started.   After 
the game, Phil was taking off his <unk> in the dressing room when 
Mike Deegan came in.   "It's a <unk> thing", Mike 
said, looking at <unk> "when a <unk> own <unk> won't come 
out and help him in a <unk>   Phil sighed and pulled the wet <unk> over his head. Frankie <unk> sat down on the bench near <unk> The other players were <unk> quietly. Eddie Lee had not 
come in yet.   Mike went over to Phil and stood over him. "Why 
the hell didn't you come out when you saw them gang up on <unk> didn't think it was <unk>   <unk> 
Now that's just <unk> You didn't think it was <unk> Mike 
placed both his hands on his <unk> He pushed his jaw forward. "Listen, <unk> guy, if you think <unk> gonna do all the fighting 
for this ball club you're <unk>   Mike had a good two inches 
over Phil and Phil had to look up into Mike's face.   "I 
didn't ask you to fight for the ball <unk> Phil said slowly. <unk> else did, <unk>   "You trying to say <I> started 
the <unk>   "I'm not trying to say <unk> turned away and opened his <unk> and then he heard Mike <unk> say: "You're yellow, <unk> and Phil <unk> 
his <unk> door shut and spun around. But before anything could happen <unk> <unk> was between them and Eddie Lee had come into the <unk> room.   <unk> come into my <unk> Eddie <unk> followed Eddie into the office and shut the door. He sat 
down before <unk> desk.   "I'm doing you a <unk> <unk> said quickly. "You get your <unk> release as of <unk> eyes <unk> just a <unk>   "The best 
thing for you to <unk> Eddie said, "is go home. You don't belong 
in professional <unk>   Phil had to clear his throat. <unk> this because of what happened out there"?   "No", <unk> said. "But it does confirm what I've suspected all <unk> stood up. <unk> This is the second time

got <unk> But what you haven't got is the heart to back up 
that talent with. The heart, Phil. You just haven't got the heart 
for <unk> and that's it".   <unk> Phil said: "I 
don't get it. My batting average **h"   Eddie stood up <unk> 
then sat down just as <unk> "What difference does your <unk> average <unk> Or your <unk> average. Or even the way you 
run bases. I tell you when it's necessary to hurt in order to <unk> 
you won't do it. <unk> what I mean by no heart for the <unk> <unk> no <unk> Deegan had no business <unk> into that <unk> out there. He did it because he knows for each guy he puts out 
of commission that's one less who might take his job away later on. 
What the hell do you think baseball <unk> A <unk> It's a way of <unk> <unk> And you've got 
to be ready to cut to <unk> anybody

and <unk> His lips felt glued together.   "I think you're <unk> <unk> he said <unk>   Eddie nodded. <unk> You'll 
get your pay in the <unk>   Phil turned and left 
the room, hearing Eddie say: <unk> you'll see I was <unk> shut the door behind him. Outside in the dressing room, <unk> <unk> sat on the bench dressed in his street <unk> <unk> Frankie asked.   Phil said: "I 
got my <unk>   "You <unk>   Phil <unk> <unk>   Phil sighed.   Frankie shook his 
head. "I don't get it".   "I don't know", Phil 
said.   They were silent for a few <unk> Then Frankie said: 
"What are you gonna do"?   Phil started to take his clothes 
off and Frankie sat down on the bench again. Phil took off one <unk> and stared at it.   "Don't take it like this", Frankie 
said. "Hell, plenty of guys get let out and come back later. The <unk> are full of guys like that".   Phil was very <unk> are you gonna do, <unk>   Phil did not <unk> not try another <unk>   Phil looked up. 
What the hell right did Eddie have saying a thing like <unk> in <unk> Frankie said. <unk> to <unk> <unk>   He just didn't know what he was talking about, 
saying a thing like that.   "Will you do it, <unk> what"?   <unk> <unk> for a job".   Phil <unk> <unk> he said. <unk> come in <unk> nodded.   "I'll speak to <unk> <unk>   "I'll talk to him, all <unk> <unk> Frankie said. "You'll get a job there. 
He needs <unk> <unk>   "I'm not worried about it", <unk> said.   "That's the way to talk. What else did Eddie 
have to <unk>   <unk> Phil <unk> next interest seemed the product of his <unk> 
His broad reading took him into certain <unk> of religion and the 
subject of religion began to <unk> him. When he was twelve he took 
to reading St& <unk> and <unk> then <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by endless <unk> and numerous <unk> papers. For his <unk> because Richard had 
seen them in a store and asked for them, his mother bought him the <unk> 
and a little image of the Indian <unk> <unk> And one 
day, on her own, his mother came home with a present entitled <The <unk> of the <unk> which she suspected Richard would <unk> He was <unk> happy with her gift and smiled, then went to his room to <unk>   At dinner one night, when he was <unk> Richard announced, <unk> is only one <unk>   "Did you think there were <unk> grinned his father.   "You don't <unk> <unk> said <unk>   Through quiet laughter his mother said, <unk> speak to your father like that, <unk>   Richard <unk> spoke <unk> and he didn't speak to his parents about <unk> again.   His interest in the formal study of religion <unk> 
when he was sixteen and he substituted for it an interest in Asian <unk> Although he still didn't speak to anyone, he grew fond 
of saying, "The future lies in <unk> when the opportunity <unk> 
and when he graduated from high school his parents sent him to New 
York to give him a <unk> they said, for his life in Asian <unk> was a solitary student in New York and <unk> 
in his <unk> a thorough if <unk> knowledge of Asian <unk> <unk> life, politics and history. He was awarded a fellowship to <unk> his studies in Tokyo and he packed up his clothes, the biwa 
upon which he had been practicing and his image of <unk> and left 
to spend a week at home before leaving the country.   The week at 
home was not comfortable. His mother, who had seen little of him for 
four years, appeared worried about his sailing off by himself for an <unk> which, she herself having slight knowledge of it, had to be <unk> 
She seemed to work to grow close to her son in the few days 
he spent at home, talking to him about some of the more pleasant moments 
of his childhood and then trying to talk to him about those things 
in which he alone was <unk>   "Do you still have <The <unk> of the <unk> she asked him and, laughing, she added, "I 
was nervous about buying a book with a title like that, but I knew <unk> like it".   "Yes", he <unk> to <unk> the conversation, 
"I still have it". He was no longer able to relax in the <unk> of his parents and found it difficult to keep up a conversation 
with his mother or father, no matter the subject. As for <The <unk> of the <unk> it along with his other books on religion had been <unk> in a furnace in the basement of the building in which 
he had lived in New York. He had <unk> each of the books carefully 
and carried them all to the basement and, trembling at having to open 
the big <unk> given them up to the <unk> Then he sped from the 
dark basement and returned to his room and cried.   Richard left 
America with his clothes, his biwa and his image of <unk> and, on the <unk> which took him to Japan, he <unk> at the <unk> trying 
to make the sounds he <unk> resemble an ancient Japanese <unk> he had 
once heard. During his second week at sea he brought the curious melody 
out of the instrument and suddenly wanted to force the biwa to remain 
at just that moment in its history when it had given him pleasure. 
He stole from his cabin late that night and crept out into a <unk> 
North Pacific wind and dropped the biwa into the water. It was so dark 
that he didn't see it hit the water and the <unk> rush of the ocean 
kept him from hearing it. It was as though the biwa had been eaten 
up 
by the wind.   In Tokyo Richard took up a life similar to 
that which he had lived in New York, except that he had replaced his <unk> with a friend. An American student named Charlotte Adams had <unk> to take notice of his evident <unk> to people and had at 
last succeeded in getting him to talk to her. He had nothing much to 
say to her but that he said anything seemed to please her and he accompanied 
her on some of her unusually searching tours of <unk> In <unk> <unk> saw a <unk> and a <unk> for doing things which, 
after a fashion, he <unk> In time, he grew to depend upon her occasional 
company and she at length was able to encourage him to participate 
in more social activity. She convinced him that he ought to be a member 
of some of the small <unk> parties she held at her rooms 
and in the end he <unk> with her <unk> although it was only rarely 
that he added anything to the random <unk>   At one such <unk> Charlotte announced, "I was at <unk> today. Have 
you ever been to <unk> No one had. "Well, it's at <unk> 
and there was a <unk> young man, quite <unk> taking a shower in 
the pool. I was thoroughly <unk>   Richard thought it a 
more promising remark than any made during the last conversation, but <unk> manner during the <unk> was more <unk> and <unk> 
than when she was alone with him and he was sure her remark would 
lead to nothing much better than the <unk> words which had preceded 
it. Three of the four persons present, all foreign students in <unk> had been playing a game of judging popular Japanese foods by 
the In and Out system, an equation in which Zen philosophy was used 
as the <unk> <unk> <unk> and tea were In because they could be 
taken <unk> <unk> was Out because it was <unk> <unk> was <unk> Samuel <unk> had <unk> because it was too far Out to 
stay <unk> even if it was a little <unk> Richard had kept his eyes 
down throughout the game, the very sound of the chatter nearly painful 
to his ears.   "He wasn't the least bit disturbed by my <unk> him", said <unk>   "Did you watch him"? asked 
a <unk> girl named <unk> <unk> "I shouldn't have been 
able to do that".   <unk> I was able to do it", Charlotte 
said with no sign of <unk> "For a minute, <unk> I'm <unk> no one has been there. I've been there a number of times. <unk> I thought you knew everything about <unk> You've never 
been to <unk>   "I've heard about it", Samuel <unk> said. "There's a little place there called <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk>   "Yes, a little <unk> <unk> Charlotte said, and <unk> <unk> it's all 
very <unk> And the man who brought sweet <unk> into <unk> is buried 
there, next to a beautiful seated statue of <unk> Oh, that's what 
I meant to tell you. This is the interesting part, <unk> 
she had a <unk> habit of trying to pull him into the talking. "There 
was that fellow out there in the bitter <unk>   "My <unk> it <was> cold <unk> said Samuel <unk> <unk> 
or <unk>   "And the water would be still <unk> <unk> seemed to <unk> at the thought of it.   "And your golden <unk> said Samuel <unk> <unk> went right home and poured 
himself into a boiling bath. It would kill one of us".   "But 
the point is", Charlotte said, "there he was, <unk> naked 
in a little stream of water at <unk> all in worship of <unk> 
the god of <unk>   <unk> dark eyes came up and seemed for 
the <unk> moment to reflect sharp light. It was <unk> <unk> 
the <unk> of wisdom, was also thought of as the Japanese version of <unk> 
The conversation went on but Richard stopped <unk> He found 
himself trying to remember something, but he couldn't decide even the 
nature of what it was he worked to <unk> He had almost given up 
when he realized that the dropping of his biwa into the icy <unk> of 
the black Pacific was the memory for which he had been <unk> Perhaps 
he sensed some connection between the incident on the <unk> 
and the <unk> at <unk> he was unable to put it together. 
That night, after leaving <unk> apartment, Richard walked 
about for a time before returning to his room. When he at last did go 
to his room, he couldn't sleep and instead paced up and down before 
his little image of <unk> thinking first of <unk> tale of 
the man at <unk> then of his biwa and the <unk> Pacific waters. 
And the next morning, not sure of why he went, he took the train 
to <unk> and walked to <unk>   He was surprised by the sharp <unk> he experienced as he approached the pool which Charlotte 
had <unk> He went through a gate to stand at the edge of the 
water and gazed at the two thin falls which dropped from large <unk> 
high at the back of the pool. On the hillside above was <unk> what might 
have been an <unk> of <unk> or perhaps a <unk> The strange <unk> housed in <unk> made him <unk> The sensation he so overwhelmingly 
realized was one which told him he had been there before 
but he knew he had not, and could not recall any place he had visited 
to be <unk> to the <unk> green water or the little <unk> 
or the green <unk> <unk> beyond his reach.   He left the pool 
and climbed the steep stone stairs to the <unk> and the sense of <unk> with the place would not leave him. Into a little well before 
the temple he dropped a <unk> coin and then he had an urge 
to sound the <unk> before the <unk> to take hold of the rope and crash 
it against the circle of <unk> but the spirit he wished to call 
out would not, he knew, come in the person of the temple <unk> Instead, 
he walked around the temple and mounted still another flight of <unk> and stood before the seated <unk> at their head. The black <unk> 
seemed to stare rigidly back at him and <unk> eyes were caught 
by the <unk> in <unk> and then Richard was shocked as, 
all at once, <unk> shot out from the sharp features of <unk> face 
and there was a terrible metallic scraping sound, as if the large statue 
were about to burst from some pressure within it. Then the <unk> 
were gone, the stillness fell upon the severe black face and Richard 
began to <unk> <unk> Suddenly he <unk> his pockets of all his <unk> and dropped them into the box before the seated <unk> and hurried 
back down both <unk> and away from the <unk> never looking 
back. He walked all the miles back to his room.   He seemed to 
have picked up a virus that day, because the next morning he had a small <unk> and felt a bit <unk> He stayed home, reading and refusing to 
think about his frightening experience at <unk> But the process 
of refusing to think about it was an active reminder in itself and he 
couldn't rid himself of a consciousness of it throughout the day. The 
cold <unk> making sleep difficult that night, and he remained 
in bed still the next morning, now unable to keep from thinking about 
the <unk> sight of burning <unk> the wretched sound, the <unk> 
feeling of having been to a remote Tokyo temple at some earlier 
time in his life. All of the elements of the experience were impossible 
and yet the reality of them was heavy upon him and he resolved never 
again to visit the temple at <unk> 
I was thinking of the heat and of water that morning when I was plowing 
the <unk> field far across the hill from the farm buildings. It 
had grown hot early that day, and I hoped that the boy, my brother's <unk> would soon come across the broad black area of <unk> ground, <unk> the jar of cool water. The boy usually was sent out at about 
that time with the water, and he always dragged an old <unk> <unk> 
or a stick along, to play with. He pretended that the <unk> was a tractor 
and he would drag it through the dirt and make <unk> tractor 
sounds with his lips.   I almost ran over the snake before I could 
stop the tractor in time. I had turned at the corner of the field 
and I had to look back to raise the plow and then to drop it again into 
the earth, and I was thinking of the boy and the water anyway, and 
when I looked again down the <unk> the snake was there. It lay half 
in the <unk> and half out, and the front wheels had rolled nearly 
up to it when I put in the <unk> The tractor was heavily loaded with 
the weight of the plow turning the earth, and the tractor stopped <unk>   The snake slid slowly and with great care from the 
new ridge the plow had made, into the <unk> and did not go any further. 
I had never liked snakes much, I still had that kind of quick panic 
that I'd had as a child whenever I saw one, but this snake was 
clean and bright and very beautiful. He was <unk> and graceful 
and he lay in the <unk> and moved his arched and tapered head only 
so slightly. Go out of the <unk> <unk> I said, but it did not move 
at all. I pulled the <unk> of the tractor in and out, hoping to <unk> him with the noise, but the snake only <unk> its black, <unk> <unk> and faced the huge tractor wheel, without <unk> or <unk> let the engine idle then, and I got down and went around 
the wheel and stood beside it. My movement did frighten the snake and 
it raised its head and trailed <unk> a couple of feet and stopped 
again, and its tongue was working very rapidly. I followed it, looking 
at the brilliant colors on its <unk> back, the colors clear and 
sharp and <unk> in orange and green and brown <unk> the size of 
a baby's fist down its back, and the <unk> were set one within the 
other and <unk> with glistening <unk> The colors were <unk> 
clear and bright, and it was as if the body held a fire of 
its own, and the colors came through that transparent flesh and skin, 
vivid and alive and <unk> The eyes were clear and black and the slender 
body was arched slightly. His flat and gracefully tapered head lifted 
as I looked at him and the black tongue slipped in and out of that <unk> mouth.   You beauty, I said, I couldn't kill you. You 
are much too beautiful. I had killed snakes before, when I was <unk> 
but there had been no animal like this one, and I knew it was <unk> that an animal such as that should die. I picked him up, 
and the length of him arched very carefully and gracefully and only a 
little <unk> and I could feel the <unk> of that <unk> <unk> <unk> like splendid <unk> and I knew that he had eaten only recently 
because there were two whole and solid little <unk> in the <unk> 
of him, like <unk> swallowed whole might make.   The body <unk> through my hands like cool <unk> and my hands, usually <unk> 
and dark, were pale beside it, and I asked it where the fire colors 
could come from the <unk> of that body. I lowered him so he would 
not fall and his body slid out onto the cool, <unk> earth, from 
between my pale hands. The snake worked away very slowly and <unk> 
and with a <unk> kind of dignity and beauty, and he carried 
his head a little above the rolled <unk> The sharp, burning colors of 
his body stood brilliant and plain against the black <unk> like a <unk> felt good and satisfied, looking at the <unk> It <unk> 
in its bright diamond color against the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> black <unk> of soil and against the <unk> of myself. The 
color and beauty of it were strange and wonderful and somehow <unk> too, 
in that dry and dusty and <unk> field.   I got on the tractor 
again and I had to watch the plow closely because the field was 
drawn across the long hillside and even in that good soil there was a <unk> of <unk> I had my back to the corner of the <unk> field 
that pointed towards the house. The earth was a little heavy and I 
had to stop once and clean the <unk> because they were not <unk> <unk> and I did not look back towards the place until I had turned 
the corner and was plowing across the upper line of the large field, 
a long way from where I had stopped because of the <unk> 
I saw it all at a <unk> The boy was there at the lower corner of 
the field, and he was in the <unk> earth, <unk> with <unk> and 
a kind of <unk> <unk> Even at that distance, with no sound but 
the sound of the <unk> I could tell the fierce mark of brutality 
on the boy. I could see the <unk> shoulders, the savage <unk> 
the dance of his feet as he ground the snake with his heels, 
and the <unk> of his arms as he whipped at it with the <unk> it, I shouted, but the <unk> and mighty tractor roared on, 
above anything I could say. I stopped the tractor and I shouted 
down to the boy, and I knew he could hear me, for the morning was clear 
and still, but he did not even hesitate in that <unk> <unk> <unk> It was no use. I felt myself <unk> thinking of the diamond 
light of that beauty I had held a few moments before, and I wanted 
to run down there and <unk> if I could, that <unk> <unk> catch 
the boy in the moment of his <unk> and save a <unk> a <unk> 
of that which I remembered, but I knew it was already too late. I 
drove the tractor on, not looking down there; I was afraid to look 
for fear the evil might still be going on. My head began to <unk> and 
the <unk> of the tractor began to bother my eyes, and I hated the job <unk> and I thought, there are only moments when one sees beautiful <unk> and these are soon <unk> or they <unk> I felt the <unk> mount within me.   The boy waited at the corner, with the <unk> of water held up to me in his hands, and the water had grown <unk> 
in the heat of the morning. I knew the boy well. He was eleven and 
we had done many things together. He was a beautiful boy, really, with <unk> blonde hair and a smooth and still <unk> face, and 
his <unk> were long and dark and <unk> and his eyes were <unk> 
He waited there and he smiled as the tractor came up, as he would <unk> on any other day. He was my <unk> my brother's son, handsome 
and warm and <unk> with happiness upon his face and his face <unk> my brother's and mine as well.   I saw then, too, 
the stake driven straight and hard into the <unk> <unk> through something 
there where I had been not long before.   I stopped the tractor 
and climbed down and the boy came eagerly up to me. "Can I <unk> around with you"? he asked, as he often did, and I had as often 
let him be on the tractor beside me. I looked closely at his eyes, 
and he was already <unk> the killing was already forgotten in 
that clear mind of his.   "No, you <unk> I said, pushing 
aside the water jar he offered to me. I pointed to the <unk> upright <unk> "Did you do that"? I asked.   "Yes", he 
said, <unk> beginning a kind of dance of <unk> "I killed 
a <unk> it was a big one". He tried to take my hand to show 
me.   "Why did you kill it"?   <unk> are ugly and <unk>   "This snake was very beautiful. <unk> you see 
how beautiful it <unk>   <unk> are <unk> he said <unk> saw the colors of it, didn't you? Have you ever 
seen anything like it around here"?   <unk> are ugly and <unk> and it might have <unk> <unk> and they would have <unk> know there are no <unk> snakes in this area. This <unk> could not harm <unk>   "They eat chickens <unk> 
the boy said. "They are ugly and they eat chickens and I <unk> <unk>   "You are talking <unk> I said. "You <unk> it because you wanted to kill it, for no other <unk> ugly and I hate them", the boy <unk> "Nobody <unk> <unk>   "It was <unk> I said, half to <unk>   The boy skipped along beside me, and he was contented 
with what he had done.   The fire of the colors was <unk> there 
was a <unk> <unk> <unk> the colors of its back were dull and <unk> torn and smashed in, and dirty from the boy's shoes. 
The <unk> head, so delicate and so cool, had been <unk> 
as if in a <unk> and the <unk> tongue <unk> out of the <unk> <unk> mouth. The snake was <unk> and I remembered, even then, the <unk> bright fire of it only a little while before, and I thought 
perhaps the boy had always seen it dead and hideous like that, and had 
not even stopped to see the beauty of it in its life.   I <unk> 
the stake out, that the boy had driven through it in the <unk> 
part of its body, between the colored diamond <unk> I touched it 
and the <unk> the <unk> was gone, and even then it moved a <unk> perhaps a tiny <unk> of the dead <unk> and I hoped that it 
was truly dead, so that I would not have to kill it. And then it moved 
a little more, and I knew the snake was dying, and I would have 
to kill it there. The boy stood off a few feet and he had the stake again 
and he was racing <unk> in <unk> making the <unk> tractor 
sound with his lips.   I'm sorry, I thought to the <unk>

But due to the many applicants on file, would he <unk> and write 
a personal letter giving them his son's <unk> interests and

or would not <unk> his son, <unk> in <unk> His son who had never 
held an office in any organization in the eighteen years of his life. 
His son who did not know whether he wanted to be doctor, lawyer, merchant

he should have kept in touch. <unk> back for <unk> But he had been <unk> building a business, being a big man in his own town just as 
he had been a big man at <unk> Class of <unk> Besides, Cady Partlow 
knew he wasn't the <unk>   It wouldn't help <unk> <unk> at Pete <unk> who hadn't missed a Hanford ball game

still feel a cold sweat on his slightly gray <unk> as he remembered 
what a near thing <unk> had been for him at <unk> But then, 
he hadn't studied very hard. Getting elected president of the student 
body took a lot of time and <unk> <unk> put down his <unk> and started to type. <unk> response to your letter, I can in good <unk> recommend my son, <unk> in the field of <unk> stopped and looked at the picture of his son, the picture on 
his desk which had changed with the years from a laughing baby to a candidate 
for Hanford College. He didn't have to be told his son looked 
like him. David had the same gray eyes, high <unk> dark hair 
and a certain rugged <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Health, <unk>   He turned back to the typewriter with a little more <unk> "His interests range from astronomy and <unk> to <unk> <unk> and <unk> His chief motivation for <unk> at <unk> is the desire <unk>   Mr& Partlow <unk> his fist 
on the <unk> <unk> the letter. He paced to the window and looked 
at the city he had helped to <unk>   How do you tell a college 
president that your son doesn't know what he wants to do? That 
you have refused to drive him into the family business or push him 
into a profession so you can say at the club, "Of course David has 
known since he was twelve he wanted to be an <unk> or a lawyer, 
or an <unk>   How do you tell a college like Hanford that 
your son has a vast potential, that he will find <unk> Just give 
him time, give him a chance.   Cady snapped the Venetian blind <unk> and slammed himself down before the <unk> rolled in a fresh <unk> and gave his letter the same savage attention he bestowed 
on a salesman who needed to have the <unk> taken off his thick <unk> a production to make of a letter <unk> your own <unk> 
His <unk> went up in amusement at his <unk> <unk> He 
told Hanford his son wanted to go into the field of <unk> He 
told Hanford his son had participated in numerous high-school activities. 
He belonged to a social club, a civic group, little <unk> swimming <unk> and had been president of the student <unk> as well as treasurer 
of the science club.   He finished with a <unk> of good <unk> to Hanford College and signed the letter. There, that did it. 
Then he met the grave eyes of his wife, <unk> from the photograph 
next to <unk> He shoved the <unk> letter into his coat <unk> show it to Anne and see if he had <unk> anything. 
After all, his wife had written most of his letters for him in those 
first lean days of Partlow <unk> Anne had a way with words. Half 
of it was natural, half was Smith College.   Yet the whole 
of Anne was something she had never learned in any college. A woman 
had it or she didn't. Anne had it. She said what she meant and let 
it be. She never got on his back. He could take the advice or leave 
it.   He whistled as he locked the office and grinned as he 
got on the <unk>   "You look like you just heard a real <unk> 
Mr& <unk>   Cady looked at <unk> who had taken 
him 
up and down for fifteen years. "I was just thinking how things have <unk> When I went to college they begged you to come. Be our <unk> It's our <unk> Now you have to be well <unk> firm

those lines, you might say. He got a science scholarship to <unk> 
said Mr& <unk> <unk> fine, <unk> Just <unk>   As he drove home through the <unk> traffic, Cady 
felt the <unk> growing. He hadn't told anyone, but he, too, had applied 
to five colleges for <unk> They had all turned down his son. <unk> in leadership. So sorry. <unk> interests. So sorry. No

into his own pretty <unk> expensive house that he needed the <unk> <unk> had waiting for him. But tonight his drink tasted like branch 
water and even his favorite meal of <unk> and tossed salad gave no <unk> from the growing weight of the letter in his pocket. <unk> did looking at Anne ease the tension as it usually did. He liked 
looking at <unk> Most people did. He liked her blond hair and the <unk> of <unk> across her nose. From those <unk> eyes she 
saw things as clearly and honestly as David did. She always could sense 
the <unk> end of a <unk> <unk> meeting tonight, <unk> I begged off. Work to do".   "Can

her with the coffee cups and settled into his favorite chair in the comfortable <unk> room. "I didn't know I looked so <unk> word, <unk> Your fur has been rubbed the <unk> way and you show it. Need any <unk>   "In a way, yes. <unk> College hasn't decided on <unk> application yet. They 
want a letter from me on his <unk> interests and leadership. Here's 
what I <unk>   Cady handed her the letter, drank his <unk> and waited with what he suddenly realized was <unk> <unk> he could feel <unk> questioning eyes.   "I know you 
wrote this in a hurry, <unk> <unk> Dave was only <unk> president 
of the student <unk> for a few days. That was when half the school 
was down with <unk>   "But he <was> <unk> <unk> he wasn't really <unk> treasurer of the science club.

you know he is advertising his <unk> equipment for sale this <unk> He hasn't used it now for several years. Can you really 
say his motivation for college is <unk>   Cady felt 
the <unk> as though he had stepped off the curb on his <unk> "And what 
would you say he wants to do? Just what"?   "It's <unk> who is applying to Hanford College. Why don't you ask <unk> once Cady Partlow wished Anne would yell at him so 
he could yell back. "I have talked to him, but you know I've never 
tried to push him into any profession. I won't be guilty of trying

for the hospital <unk> "Just because your father tried to make

You want him to be a leader of men, like you".   Cady put the <unk> chip back on his shoulder. <unk> <unk> qualities of leadership. 
He just hasn't developed them yet. Give him <unk> never will, <unk> Not the kind of leadership you mean, working 
with lots of people. All your wishful thinking won't change 
that. <unk> what you used to say in the <unk> You can't run a war 
with <unk> generals and one <unk>   Cady walked 
the block to the <unk> almost ashamed of himself for arguing with <unk> felt it was incredible that the situation had come to exist 
at all. And once <unk> had grown to such monstrous <unk> 
The pair of white cotton shorts ruled his life.   <unk> awake 
at night, he could see them, laid out on the floor of his mind. When 
he rose in the morning, the image was still there.   He had always 
been a <unk> and <unk> man. In his <unk> days, his bedroom 
had been <unk> with clothes which his mother, or later the hotel <unk> 
generally saw fit to put in order. No doubt Dolores resented following 
in their <unk>   But it was fun those first days, <unk> 
about the trail of <unk> he left <unk> across the <unk> There 
was an <unk> <unk> in his <unk> refusal to pick them up. Half <unk> he enjoyed seeing her <unk> to lift the things.   He 
remembered the first time he saw her, standing across the room at a party. 
The smooth curve of her neck, very white against hair which curled 
against it like <unk> Her hair was the color of those <unk> which 
in seed <unk> are referred to as <unk> but since no flower 
is actually without color contain always a hint of <unk> or purple 
or <unk> he wanted to draw the broad <unk> of hair through his fingers, <unk> it slowly for a trace of <unk> which might reveal its 
true shade beneath the darkness.   So he sought her out, and spoke 
to her, and thought of his hand in her hair. Or against her back, <unk> on the column of <unk> which held her so <unk> 
straight and <unk> until the segments of bone made tiny sharp cracking <unk> like the snapped stem of a <unk>   But, to put it <unk> nothing snapped. Yet that had not seriously troubled him, 
not then. They married. More he could take at <unk> All Martin 
thought he needed was <unk> to what better use could time be <unk> saw later that they had made their marriage too quickly. There 
was too little occasion <unk> for <unk> the brave strong <unk> of emotional clash and meeting. They had left themselves 
too much to <unk>   But, at the start, his new life felt <unk> <unk>   It was on the <unk> day after the wedding <unk> 
could it have been so <unk> that he dropped the shorts on the <unk> I'm not going to pick up those <unk> gave her a <unk> <unk> "I think you'll get tired of 
them there".   In the morning the shorts were where he had left 
them. He smiled to himself, and decided not to mention them till <unk> did. It was almost too easy. For he had just <unk> <unk> they were having their first guests. The shorts would not be 
on the floor when he came home that evening.   He was wrong. The 
rest of the bedroom had been <unk> to a <unk> <unk> but in 
the middle of the carpet lay the <unk> shorts. They gave the room 
a strange note of <unk> like a <unk> on a beautiful <unk> saw that Dolores intended to wait until the last minute, thinking 
he would get <unk> <unk> he determined to foil her. I can 
be as stubborn as she can, he <unk> my nerves are as strong. <unk> <unk> to the bedroom when the <unk> <unk>   It <unk> Ten 
minutes early.   Martin was standing a few feet from the front 
door. He swung around, eyes toward the bedroom, some fifteen feet 
away. Dolores stood <unk> in the doorway.   He could not cross 
the living room, brush past her, and bend down to <unk> the <unk> turned his back. He strode to answer the <unk> hat was deposited in the hall <unk> With the most casual 
and relaxed manner in the world, Dolores led <unk> to the bedroom. 
Martin strained his ears.   At first he could not be sure. 
Then he caught just enough to know that the shorts were still there. 
A <unk> of <unk> slid over their <unk>   All evening <unk> <unk> him with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> she had been instructed <unk> to say a <unk> For some reason, this <unk> in the conversation 
spread until it swallowed up every other <unk> At last there 
was a <unk> no one could <unk> The <unk> went home <unk> realized, later on, that he should have <unk> it out" with <unk> that night. As violently as possible. But he was so taken <unk> he could not believe any rage of his would make her give in. 
On the contrary, it would only weaken his position if he <unk> while 
she stayed calm and <unk> And if he surrendered <unk> <unk> 
at her. **h He <unk>   Suppose he ran up the white flag <unk> 
At once. He considered the sober possibility.   In 
his head was the <unk> of those <unk> with <unk>   There was 
something about private feminine <unk> which always made him feel <unk> and <unk> He remembered his mother <unk> with her <unk> women friends, <unk> her voice to a penetrating <unk> 
which might be trusted to carry to the head of the stairs, where he <unk> <unk> He could even recall the last time he sat there. 
She was talking about him that time, because he had done some bad thing, 
something she <unk> but <unk> Martin said he was sorry. 
He <unk> so <unk> I couldn't keep being annoyed with <unk> It wasn't even true that he'd said he was sorry that time; 
he had in fact said simply that he wished the thing hadn't happened, 
which was as honest as he could put it. But his mother told the 
story over and over, till her <unk> said he was <unk> was as 
much a part of her as the shape of her thin, <unk> ears.   The 
battle had to be <unk> Let the best sex <unk>   But his resolution 
hardly seemed to help. If the situation had been <unk> it now got <unk> About this time people began <unk> <unk> considering 
that the newly married had been left alone long enough. <unk> Martin <unk> they had delayed the wedding and gone on a <unk> preferably 
one that lasted <unk> instead of deciding not to postpone the date 
until he could get away. Here they were at the mercy of anyone who 
chose to come by. These stray people nearly always insisted on Dolores <unk> them around the apartment. Of course, the tours of inspection 
included the ever-present shorts.   It was curious how the 
different visitors took this. Some tried to ignore the <unk> on the <unk> <unk> Others asked. Quite a few laughed. To them 
all Dolores told a <unk> and witty <unk>   "It's a little <unk> Martin and I <unk> she would begin <unk> carrying 
the anecdote through a <unk> and <unk> course. While he waited 
in the living room.   Once Martin went along. They entered the <unk> and Dolores said nothing. Then one of the guests showed his <unk> "You were in a hurry, weren't you"? Martin would 
have liked to break the man's neck. Dolores <unk> she let the <unk> stand. Now Martin heard himself give a <unk> of mock 
good nature. With her eyes Dolores dared him for the truth, ready to <unk> <unk> a little <unk>   Never again did he <unk> into the ritual of showing the apartment.   They kept up a <unk> <unk> of speaking relations. But Martin seldom felt the impulse 
to talk about anything. What to talk <unk>   Dolores kept <unk> up any of his clothes (except the fatal <unk> which he left <unk> but he had been robbed of pleasure in <unk> his <unk> 
He fell into the habit of putting his clothes in <unk> and <unk> 
so his life might <unk> as little as possible on hers. The <unk> alone <unk>   In his moments of worst <unk> Martin <unk> what his friends were saying. The sound of their <unk> <unk> He could hear the word. <The most <unk> situation. 
We were up to visit them <unk> **h   He had thought her exactly 
what he <unk> Six weeks of marriage and I'm using the past tense, 
he told himself <unk> <unk> his idea, he saw that it would 
be impossible to leave her now. Everyone would know <unk> he would 
cut a <unk> ridiculous figure.   He was <unk>   Day 
and night Martin could not drag his mind from the dilemma he had made 
for himself. His mind <unk> <unk> seeking an <unk> <unk> 
he had periods of hostile <unk> in which he determined <unk> <unk> to live out his life in this fashion. Nothing would <unk> nothing would ever change.   When the solution finally 
came to him, one night while he was in bed, he was so shaken by its simplicity 
that he could only wonder why it had not occurred to him <unk> a <unk> of <unk> he considered his plan. <unk> his <unk> he would place something of hers.   <unk> 
he would have won an <unk> moral victory, for if she picked 
up, say, a pair of her <unk> she might just as well lift his <unk> lying <unk> the expenditure of energy was almost the same. 
He felt that it would be a particular <unk> to Dolores to pick 
up her own <unk> which he had laid on the floor. Furthermore, 
he could go on repeating the <unk> <unk> every time he went 
in the bedroom, he could drop a slip or a <unk> or maybe a <unk> 
next to his shorts. <unk> or later, Dolores would <unk> On the 
other hand, if she didn't remove her own things, it would be difficult 
to explain to the parade of guests which <unk> the <unk> guessed that Dolores would not be so eager to tell the 
next <unk> of her story. The <unk> he thought, would become less <unk> She had used his <unk> shorts as the very image of his <unk> 
his lack of control, his general male <unk> while she 
remained cool, <unk> and <unk> the charming teacher who disciplined 
an <unk> body. To have her <unk> linked with his on the floor 
would draw her visibly into a struggle both bitter and <unk> in the back of his mind was aware that the <unk> 
of the plan lay in his faith, that the idea would work because he believed 
in it, since his courage and <unk> were involved, because it 
was truly his. The knowledge kept him from analyzing his scheme to death, 
and took him through the last hours of that night in a peace of exalted <unk>   The next morning, while Dolores was out of 
the room, he went to her bureau <unk> took out a pair of <unk> lace <unk> and <unk> dropped them next to his shorts. He sat down on 
the bed.   In a surprisingly short time, Dolores appeared. To 
his <unk> her eyes focused at once upon the two <unk> <unk> and <unk> she reached down and touched the lace with her fingers, 
then hesitated for about a second. Ah, he thought, she's going through 
the chain of reasoning which says she might really just as well <unk> up my shorts too. He saw that in a moment she had grasped all the <unk> of a plot which had been weeks in occurring to him. <unk> 
her fingers another <unk> she caught up the <unk> and swiftly 
left the room. She did not look at him, but he noticed that her face 
was <unk> and her eyes <unk>   They <unk> together, 
but Martin did not refer to his <unk> and Dolores found a great 
deal to do in the kitchen, <unk> up and down from the table so that 
talk was impossible. Well, Martin thought, <unk> <unk> He left 
for work in high <unk>   As he relaxed that day, Martin realized 
how tense he had been these past weeks. He found that he no longer <unk> Dolores (he knew how much he had hated <unk> and he was <unk> at a <unk> of an <unk> <unk> old <unk> Cap said. "You know, I've got 
one of your cars at home. as a prominent <unk> you ought to 
be interested in his <unk> support group. Isn't his <unk> down 
your <unk>   <unk> it <unk> William thought. <unk> not 
any <unk>   A rush of memory swept him back, and he forgot <unk> 
How did he start on such a ride to brief <unk> Simply enough, 
through the <unk> agency of his <unk> General <unk> <unk> and Doc <unk> and Cap were responsible for his first <unk> but <unk> Freddy Bryan could take <unk> if he cared 
to (and he <unk> for the second time. Freddy needed a job, having been <unk> from a rather dangerous career in real estate and <unk> <unk> by <unk> and it was up to Arthur Willis to provide him 
with one.   Mr& Willis bought <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> corporation of sorts which had undergone many <unk> and 
whose principal assets were a couple of electronics plants on Long 
Island engaged in working out government <unk> and installed Freddy 
in an executive position. Shortly <unk> Freddy had his usual <unk> of bold ideas. Willis listened <unk> and once in a 
while William was exposed to them at a family <unk> he generally 
heard <unk> suggestions without interest, being absorbed by 
his own <unk> <unk>   Probably Mr& Willis was influenced 
toward deeper involvement by <unk> loyalty and a concern for 
his <unk> <unk> began to aid Freddy with her father, <unk> 
no doubt, by <unk> open contempt for Freddy and <unk> <unk> <unk> Another factor must have been the eventual disposal 
of <unk> <unk> she unquestionably assumed that the more 
he was <unk> with <unk> the more likely he was to reward Freddy <unk> upon his death.   Whatever the reasons, Willis and Bryan 
started expanding <unk> They acquired another electronics <unk> 
a specialized <unk> company, an organization that <unk> very <unk> <unk> research <unk> Since they were <unk> for national defense <unk> Adam <unk> a man of surprising <unk> entered the combination as a silent partner because 
of his political <unk>   <unk> his power, Freddy looked 
for additional <unk> to <unk> <unk> industry, <unk> toward <unk> 
government <unk> attracted him. The <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> firm which manufactured <unk> vehicles 
and other <unk> equipment, had recently constructed an <unk> 
modern plant in a burst of <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> 
management and <unk> stockholders, it was ripe for <unk> 
and <unk> instinct was to keep growing by stock <unk> and 
small expenditure of cash, and never mind inevitable consequences. With <unk> <unk> he was convinced that <unk> Wisconsin <unk> would be ideal for conversion to airplane <unk> tanks, <unk> or <unk> of some kind.   At that point William 
came into the picture. Although not much <unk> the <unk> he had 
been appointed advertising head of <unk> <unk> of routine by having 
his own firm and a <unk> <unk> his work in New York had 
given him a broader overall knowledge of business administration and corporate <unk> and if he wasn't entirely committed to what he <unk> he was at least fascinated by the chance of wider <unk> 
Mr& <unk> eager to have him allied with the family, wanted advice 
beyond the <unk> of his field, and William set out on a serious 
study of the situation, including trips to Wisconsin and <unk> the end, he said: "I'm not <unk> by the <unk> <unk> I know a guy named Jack <unk> a very bright young <unk> who was with <unk> and I took him with me to <unk> 
It's his expert opinion that the plant isn't well suited to what 
you have in mind. The conversion will cost a <unk> Besides that, 
I'm acquainted more or less with the defense hardware situation through 
my contacts in the Air <unk> I think Adam <unk> is guilty 
of being too hopeful and better informed on defense financing than

Mr& Willis <unk> William and <unk> did indeed run the <unk> 
From shock and <unk> most of the listeners went on to open 
resistance and <unk>   "Oh, my <unk> <unk> <unk>

an <unk>   He swayed them <unk> but the <unk> raged on. <unk> emerged as the main <unk> Mr& Willis 
made it evident that he had contributed his <unk>   "Nobody 
will <unk> it, I'm telling you", Freddy said. "I know 
what I'm talking about in that <unk>   "There's <unk> of risk <unk> <unk> <unk> added, "but not for anything 
this <unk>   "All right", William said. "We'll 
try to swing the deal on that basis. If we can't raise the <unk> <unk> through. Nothing has been lost. You're up against it <unk> 
Why won't you give me a <unk>   A silence fell. <unk> instinctively turned in <unk> direction. He smiled at William 
and slowly rubbed his hands together.   "I feel I must 
answer the <unk> he said, <unk> the <unk> later, if any, should 
fall on me- I don't <unk> <unk> spread broadcast outside 
my family **h. I'm not giving you a <unk> <unk> but <unk> <unk> of your generous offer of assistance.

"I suppose I can never 
expect to call you <unk> after that Washington <unk> afraid not". 
It was among these that <unk> identified a photograph of <unk> 
For it seems that <unk> <unk> himself a ladies' man (and why not, 
after seven <unk> had listed himself for <unk> <unk> roles 
at the <unk> of his fourth murder victim who had said: "With 
your beard, dear, you ought to be in <unk>   Mills <unk> Barco's photograph from the gentleman in charge, rushed to 
the Hollywood police station to report the <unk> and less than five 
minutes later, detectives with his picture in hand were on the trail 
of <unk> <unk>   On their way, they stopped at every gas station 
along the main <unk> to question the <unk> Finally, at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Station on <unk> Avenue, they learned that 
their man, having paused to get oil for his car, had asked about the <unk> to San <unk> They headed in that direction and, at San Juan <unk> <unk> came upon Barco sitting in the quaint old <unk> Mission <unk> eating a hot <unk> At the moment, Barco's 
back was to the road so he didn't see the detectives close in 
on his convertible which, in their quest for the stolen <unk> <unk> they <unk> to <unk> The <unk> however, was <unk> for by that time <unk> had disposed of it at a <unk> in <unk>   The detectives 
placed Barco under arrest and, without <unk> him of the 
nature of the charge, took him back to Hollywood for <unk> it was that <unk> <unk> for mere <unk> now began 
to suspect that one or another of his <unk> had been <unk> During 
the return trip, Barco kept <unk> to himself in meaningless <unk> such as: "They're under sand <unk> **h They're better 
off, I tell you **h I saved their <unk> The <unk> <unk> 
on Barco's behavior, felt that he merely belonged among the myriad 
citizens of our community who are mentally <unk> that he was 
a more or less <unk> <unk>   However while in his cell <unk> trial for <unk> <unk> in a fit of <unk> made an 
attempt to take his own life. The attempt had failed because, when <unk> to cut his <unk> this murderer of seven women had <unk> 
at the sight of blood. The jail <unk> <unk> no particular 
significance to the <unk> offered Barco whisky to revive him; 
but the old <unk> a <unk> <unk> refused it, and no more 
was thought of the matter.   Then it was that District Attorney <unk> entered the case. A man of <unk> ambition, with one eye 
on the <unk> of Los Angeles, nothing ever escaped him which might <unk> lead to personal <unk>   It was reported to <unk> 
office that a <unk> in the city jail had attempted suicide. Welch 
wanted to know why. No one <unk> Now Welch had a pet theory that 
everyone is guilty of breaking more laws than he ever gets caught at. 
The <unk> attempt looked to him like an opportunity to put his theory 
to the test. So he paid a call on Barco in his cell and began their <unk> by stating <unk>   <unk> we've got the goods 
on <unk> It'll be a lot better if you come <unk>   At 
first Barco was <unk> and <unk> But with <unk> <unk> pursuit 
of the subject, Barco finally <unk> and started <unk> 
to one murder after another. By the time Barco reached the count 
of <unk> the situation seemed to Welch almost too good to be true. But 
if true, it was the case of which he had <unk> the case which would <unk> him into <unk> all over America as the hero of a great <unk> trial.   Welch summoned jail officials to Barco's cell. 
But to <unk> <unk> the police captain <unk> <unk> <unk> in Barco's <unk> Barco was clearly a <unk> 
It required strength, <unk> daring to commit murder. "That <unk> 
a <unk> <unk> Then, for the first time since his <unk> a <unk> of spirit lit Barco's eyes. His <unk> had been <unk> 
He <unk> and rose to his feet. He'd show <unk> that <unk> he <unk> "Well, for ten years I've been <unk> women. I can lead you to every one of the bodies, and there <unk> four, nor <unk> nor six of <unk> there's <unk> next day the police captain, in <unk> organized what 
he termed <unk> Wild <unk> <unk> For indeed it seemed <unk> that anyone could go on <unk> murder for ten years and 
not get caught at it, even in <unk> The searching party consisted 
of the police captain, <unk> <unk> policemen with <unk> newspaper <unk> and <unk>   <unk> his state of apprehension <unk> never to return, had assumed a <unk> which remained 
his principal attitude from that time on. He directed the <unk> 
of <unk> to the sand <unk> near Santa <unk> <unk> the cars at 
a fork in the road, he got out, paced off a certain distance to a spot 
between two <unk> sand hills, and indicated a <unk> were given to <unk> Nothing was found. Welch was <unk> 
The police captain <unk> The newspaper boys cracked jokes and again <unk> pride was <unk> With greater precision he again paced 
off a <unk> this time a little more to the left.   With <unk> and <unk> the policemen again started <unk> Welch was on edge. 
The captain was <unk> that it was a nice day for a picnic when 
finally one of the <unk> struck an <unk>   "There's something <unk> said the <unk> <unk> stopped and everyone gathered <unk> The <unk> thrusting about with his <unk> now raised into 
view a package <unk> wrapped in one of the <unk> Hollywood <unk> <unk> Although it was a mere <unk> of the <unk> <unk> 
it was enough. Welch was wild with <unk> His <unk> grew 
as Barco's seven <unk> brought to light one reward after <unk> did Welch truly become the man of the hour, and everything 
that followed in the procedure of Justice was a new triumph 
for 
him. It went to his head, and his ambition <unk>   It was <unk> that Welch was in <unk> with Marshall and would use his power 
as <unk> to drag every possible sensation into the case. Every 
new <unk> which would provide more <unk> for <unk> <unk> would thus mean more publicity for <unk>   I knew that both 
these <unk> were waiting with impatience for the dramatic moment when <unk> was called to the stand. Once there, the <unk> with <unk> <unk> would provide Marshall with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Lake an <unk> <unk> 
of Another <unk> <unk> It would be fine publicity for the 
man who was willing to walk to the <unk> <unk> over the broken <unk> of a helpless <unk>   I studied Welch closely as 
the trial progressed for any hint which might give me a lead as to how 
he might be <unk> It wasn't long before I sensed that there was 
something deeper than <unk> ambition back of his desire for <unk> destruction. He was bitter and <unk> toward her, <unk> <unk> A dreadful fear entered my consciousness that perhaps 
he had entertained <unk> toward <unk> <unk> or, even 
more serious perhaps, that he had attained a share of them and had 
then been <unk> by some <unk> <unk> I did not rest until I had <unk> the mystery down. Well, here it is.   One day over a 
year before, there had been a cocktail party in an apartment of a downtown <unk> Viola had been urged to <unk> by <unk> and not knowing 
the host or the character of the party, she had gone. She arrived 
late and as she entered the party, noted that gentlemen seemed to be 
in the <unk> the air was thick with smoke, empty bottles were 
in evidence, and several of the guests were somewhat the worse for <unk> Viola had no wish to <unk> but she felt she 
couldn't leave so soon after her <unk> in all <unk> to her <unk> And it so happened that adjacent to a couch on which she had taken <unk> was a small table on which she noted a <unk> of red <unk> 
while projecting from beneath the couch were a pair of feet which, 
as <unk> would have it, belonged to District Attorney <unk> Viola sat there, a <unk> impulse <unk> her to remove the shoes 
and socks from the <unk> feet and, as a <unk> insert <unk> 
between the <unk>   A little later the district attorney woke 
up, emerged from under the <unk> looked at his watch, and realized 
he had an engagement that very hour to address a meeting of the <unk> <unk> on "The <unk> Spirit of the <unk> in the <unk> 
room of the hotel where his wife, as president of the <unk> was 
to <unk> He made his way to his <unk> bedroom where he carefully <unk> himself off, neatly arranged his hair, and <unk> selected 
his hat from the many on the bed. Then, noting neither the absence 
of his <unk> nor the presence of the <unk> he made his way 
to the <unk> room and, with his usual dignity, mounted the <unk> 
The effect on the intellectuals among his audience may well be <unk> <unk> aside from reflecting on <unk> political <unk> had all but wrecked his home life. He never rested until 
he discovered who the <unk> was, and when he did, he vowed vengeance 
on Viola Lake if ever the chance came his way. <And here it <unk> 
By such innocent actions are human tragedies sometimes set in <unk>   During these first days of the trial I didn't have 
as much time to <unk> with Viola as I should have <unk> In the 
first place, it was difficult for us to <unk> We couldn't be seen <unk> for the tongue of <unk> was ever ready to link our names, 
and the tongue of <unk> finds but one thing to say of the association 
of a man with a girl, no matter how <unk> I couldn't invite <unk> to our house, for Mother <unk> refused to receive <unk> the <unk> had not affected my own sense of social values, 
but Mother had attained a reflected glory through it, which had 
opened the doors of Los <unk> Society to her. There, Mother 
was received by the <unk> of <unk> lines which are dominated 
by the <unk> (of beer <unk> the <unk> (of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> founded a nationally famous 
trade in <unk> I hated being dragged into the <unk> of these <unk> But Mother <unk> for it is seldom indeed that anyone <unk> connected with the <unk> is ever received in their exclusive <unk> In fact, it was not until the King of <unk> had visited 
at <unk> that Mary and <unk> were beckoned to cross the sacred <unk> which separate Los Angeles and <unk> from the <unk> even went so far as to <unk> up for me <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> who had been educated abroad, and 
with those of the more <unk> Los Angeles area where a <unk> was 
a girl who had been to high school. But at long last came a time when 
I broke away from Mother and her society <unk> in order 
to spend a <unk> evening with Viola and her <unk> at her <unk> such a <unk> of gossip had grown up during the trial, that 
every precaution had to be taken to keep my visit from being whispered 
to the world, Society, and even, <unk> to my own mother. 
When I arrived at <unk> 
I was <unk> to my surprise, into the <unk> <unk> greeted me, in checked <unk> <unk> in hand, and explained 
it was the <unk> night out and that she herself was preparing <unk>   I sat and watched <unk> There was to be roast <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> new peas with a <unk> 
of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> all <unk> <unk> 
and cooked by Viola herself. 
I realized that <unk> was faced with an entirely different problem, 
but his <unk> could have been no greater. The most that was accomplished 
was adding Mrs& <unk> tray to the dish <unk> and by means 
of repeated <unk> on an <unk> scale, seeing that the girls dressed <unk> after a fashion.   I was saved from making the 
decision as the phone <unk> and the girls were upon me instantly. Here's 
a household <unk> if you can't find your children, and get tired 
of calling them, pick up the phone. No matter if your children are 
at the movies, in school, visiting their <unk> or on a field 
trip in some distant city, they will be upon you <unk> within seconds 
after you pick up the phone.   <unk> and <unk> <unk> themselves 
around me, <unk> <unk> <unk> climbed onto a stool 
and clutched the hand with which I was trying to hold the phone, claiming 
my immediate attention on grounds of extreme emergency. Somehow <unk> to get out a cool, <unk> <unk> you hold on a second, <unk> I covered up the <unk> and with more warmth and less <unk> gave a quick lecture on crime and <unk> mostly the <unk> 
including <unk> Island and the <unk> reaches of <unk> 
I promised to illustrate the <unk> if they so much as <unk> 
till after the call was completed.   Speaking into the phone 
again and recognizing the <unk> I resumed my everyday voice. Soon 
we were deep in a conversation that was interrupted many times by little 
things like <unk> holding her breath and pretending to black 
out, <unk> <unk> the contents of the sugar bowl on the table, 
and various <unk> <unk> and <unk> Under the circumstances, 
I had difficulty keeping up with the conversation on the phone, but when 
I hung up I was reasonably certain that <unk> had wanted to <unk> me of our town meeting the next evening, and how important it 
was that Hank and I be there.   I discovered that the girls had <unk> <unk> the kitchen, and were playing quietly in the living <unk> It seemed that I would be the <unk> if I accepted the peace 
and quiet, instead of carrying out my <unk>   <unk> to get 
something done, I started in on the <unk> No. I'm not saying 
it right. What I meant to say was that I started to start in on the <unk> by gathering them all together in the kitchen <unk> They looked 
so <unk> however, so <unk> that I found myself staring 
at them in <unk> and starting to <unk> again, this time about <unk> and her husband. How about them, I thought.   <unk> 
and Herbert were among the few people we knew in <unk> 
We didn't even know them till about a month after we <unk> at that 
time, they had called on us, after I met Fran at a <unk> meeting, 
and had taken us in hand <unk> They had been kind to us and 
we were indebted to them for one or two pleasant <unk> and for information 
as to where to shop, which <unk> doctor, <unk> and sitter 
to call (not that there was much of a choice, since Catatonia was 
just a <unk> the yellow pages of the telephone book were <unk> <unk>   They were <unk> <unk> an expert on narrow <unk> thin <unk> and <unk> was men's fashion editor of <unk> 
the weekly magazine with the tremendous <unk> Fran 
and he had met about two years after she had arrived in Manhattan from <unk> or was it <unk> She was the daughter and sole <unk> 
of either a cattle <unk> or an oil <unk> and, having arrived 
in New York with a big bank <unk> became a <unk> in various fields. 
She <unk> Greenwich Village artists for <unk> then put some 
money into a Broadway show which was successful <unk> but <unk> 
It was during her <unk> period that she and <unk> 
met and decided that they were in love. They were married at a <unk> <unk> which was duly recorded in <unk> and all other magazines 
and newspapers, and then they <unk> in <unk> No, not <unk> <unk> was not in style that year. They had <unk> in <unk> everyone was very high on Rome that year.   They had bought 
their house in Catatonia after investigating all the regions of <unk> surrounding New <unk> they had chosen Catatonia because 
of its reputation for excellent schools, <unk> and abundance of <unk> are bound to get involved with people when you have <unk> Fran had told me at our first meeting, "so it is good 
to know that those with whom you get involved are not just dreary little <unk> and dull <unk> but People Who Do <unk> admired their easy way of doing things but I couldn't escape 
an <unk> at their way of <unk> doing the <unk> things. 
Their house was a <unk> Colonial which they had had restored <unk> by an eminent <unk> and <unk> and added on to. It had 
a <unk> corner <unk> of a <unk> a breakfast room, a luncheon <unk> a dining room, a sitting room, a room for standing up, a 
party room, dressing rooms for <unk> even a room for <unk> It was 
all set up so there would be no dust anywhere and so that their children 
would color in the <unk> room, paint in the painting room, play 
with <unk> in the block house, and do all the other things in the proper 
rooms at exactly the right time. Their two boys were <unk> <unk> 
and, like their parents, always did the right thing at the right 
time and damn the consequences.   <unk> and Herbert considered 
themselves violently <unk> and showed the world they were 
by filling their Colonial house with contemporary furniture and paintings 
and other art objects <unk> but not necessarily <unk> contemporary <unk> Fran <unk> her independence by <unk> against 
the Catatonia uniform of Bermuda shorts and <unk> socks by <unk> Bermuda shorts and <unk> socks in <unk> bright <unk> and <unk> and vivid <unk> Sometimes she even wore the uniform 
in <unk> <unk> black, and with her blonde hair cut so <unk> <unk> this <unk> she strongly resembled a member of the <unk> one could dislike them, I thought. <unk> though, they 
did not seem quite <unk> It seemed, indeed, that their house was 
not so much a home, but rather a perfect stage set, and that they were <unk> who had been handed fat roles in a successful play, and had talent 
enough to fill the roles <unk> with nice <unk> <unk> 
the only enthusiasm they showed was when they were discussing <unk> even brand names. You should hear the <unk> in <unk> voice when she said <unk> or <unk> or <unk> <unk> She always let it be known that there was wine 
in the pot roast or that the chicken had been <unk> in <unk> and 
that <unk> second cousin was an intimate of <unk> wouldn't have wasted time puzzling over this couple were it not 
for my fear that all the other inhabitants of Catatonia were equally <unk> I couldn't feel at home among them. Besides <unk> 
there was <unk> <unk> was pleasant and <unk> but Blanche 
was <unk> Yes, Blanche was <unk> very <unk> being in her company 
was like being <unk> in warm, melted <unk> I had once been 
a witness when Blanche had smiled and said with only minimum <unk> <unk> my <unk> has <unk> <unk> knows how a <unk> <unk> woman would react to such a <unk> If Blanche 
had been honest, she would have yelled, slammed at least a couple of <unk> and thrown a few little, <unk> things. But dear me, <unk> 
not <unk>   After five minutes with <unk> one might welcome 
the <unk> 
of <unk> who was a sort of <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> were <unk> committee <unk> and they usually managed to be elected <unk> equal <unk> of whatever <unk> or civic project was being <unk> They 
were <unk> not because they were fond of each other, but because 
they wanted to keep an eye on each other, as they were keen <unk> 
for social leadership. <unk> was <unk> quietly mean, and <unk> <unk> <unk> She it was who had looked to see if I was <unk> shoes upon learning that I couldn't drive. <unk> had a small, <unk> head and her hair and skin were the color of golden <unk> 
She lived in an <unk> house whose <unk> <unk> <unk> 
and even <unk> were chosen to complement her <unk> the <unk> 
were a couple of <unk> <unk> Her uniform was of rich, raw <unk> in 
a shade which matched her hair, skin, <unk> and cats, and since 
she was so thin as to be almost <unk> she rather resembled a frozen <unk> <unk>   The husbands of these women and others I had 
met in Catatonia were distinguished only in that they were, to me at <unk> <unk> I couldn't tell one from the other. Like <unk> they were all in <unk> <unk> television, magazines, 
and <unk> One or two were writers of <unk> all were <unk> 
of finite charm. Each had developed a <unk> <unk> and 
the habit of saying <unk> in <unk> to <unk> 
I never thought I'd live to hear people <unk> and say <unk> 
in real life. I wouldn't have missed it for anything. They 
were <unk> men of the <unk> <unk> and the urgent <unk> These boys acknowledged an introduction to anybody by gently <unk> one of his hands in both of <unk> while they <unk> <unk> 
with care, into the eyes of the person they were meeting. Could such <unk> love, for a total stranger, be <unk> They were 
always <unk> to light <unk> open car <unk> fill plates or <unk> 
and I <unk> the whole lot of them to the same degree that 
I <unk> <unk> shops that called themselves <unk> Bake <unk> <unk> I thought, and wondered what 
kind of <unk> such odd <unk> would establish in this suburban <unk> <unk> who looked like <unk> <unk> even at <unk> <unk> and who never called the school principal <unk> 
I <unk> thinking that among other things, people here seemed 
to be those who would have to cut down if they earned less than <unk> <unk> people who would give their teeth for a chance to get 
on <unk> to <unk> people who thought it was nice to be important, 
but not important to be <unk> who were more <unk> than <unk> more personalities than persons. In my <unk> they 
were people who read <unk> du <unk> and discussed <unk> well, 
not <unk> him <unk> but said, <unk> <unk> 
and raised their eyes, as if they were at a loss to describe how they 
felt about <unk> which they were, because they had no opinions about <unk> not having read <unk> They were, I felt, people invariably 
trying to prove not who, but what they were, and trying to determine <unk> not who, others were.   <unk> aware that it was nearly <unk> I brought myself back to the tasks at hand. I made plans 
for the <unk> doing the breakfast and luncheon dishes all at <unk> making the <unk> and then maybe painting the kitchen. Then, I 
remembered that the girls had had a <unk> for <unk> every day for the 
last week. <unk> <unk> had shouted each time. "They're 
not <unk> They're not even food. They're just something 
you're supposed to put on cereal for <unk> I dug around 
and found a <unk> and was able to surprise them with a <unk> <unk> with chocolate <unk> <unk> I think you need only one 
rule for <unk> if you can't put <unk> in it, put chocolate in <unk>   The cake was received in a stunned silence that was evidence 
in itself of the <unk> of taste <unk> Mama had been <unk> 
Then <unk> closed her eyes, stretched forth her arms, and said: <unk> my hand, <unk> I'm a stranger in <unk> to say, I was <unk> at this <unk> <unk> 
upon free enterprise. How dared they demand to <unk> in private 
financial records, <unk> <unk> contracts and <unk> 
"It is as <unk> I said on the historic <unk> <unk> <unk> broadcast which I bought <unk> Father <unk> 
and <unk> the Eddie <unk> Manhattan <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> "That Man in the White House, like some <unk> 
of <unk> insisted on reading my <unk> <unk> my <unk> and <unk>

what quarter could a poor <unk> woman expect from a <unk>

I was also publicly <unk> dragged through the mud by the <unk> press and made a figure of fun by such <unk> publications as

Mr& Roosevelt and his <unk> had done their <unk> <unk> 
all too well, even going so far as to attempt to <unk> the highest <unk> in the land in order to defeat little me. Presidential <unk> had succeeded not only in <unk> the <unk> <unk>

as to discourage any lawyer in the nation from representing <unk> I was <unk> like <unk> to present my own <unk> But the <unk> Court wouldn't even <unk> my <unk> My plea was unanimously

of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> others, going into <unk> 
and, on more occasions than I care to count, <unk> off the <unk> 
for the rest of the day. As for his <unk> I was never privileged 
to know exactly how much money Letch had <unk> <unk> 
It was I who paid for our little home, the food, the liquor, the <unk> 
even <unk> bills at his <unk> and the Los Angeles <unk> <unk> Never once did he buy me a single gift and for our third <unk> he gave me a <unk> <unk> <unk> that is another <unk> 
As for his private <unk> they were rapidly <unk> in drinking, <unk> and <unk> More than once I was confronted by professional <unk> <unk> loan <unk> <unk> <unk> 
and <unk> <unk> people of a class I did not even know <unk> 
to repay my husband's <unk> <unk> <unk> else **h" I <unk> to think that someone so dear to me could even associate with 
such a sinister <unk> And at three different times during our <unk> marriage strange girls, with the <unk> of <unk> telephoned 
to announce to me that Letch had <unk> their <unk> <unk> <unk> the deepest of <unk> <unk> my heart fairly <unk> when 
I thought of the darling pink and white <unk> from <unk> I 
would have <unk> given my husband. <unk> you're too <unk> was <unk> his <unk> and <unk> <unk> whenever I suggested <unk> 
a <unk> Letch had made it <unk> clear that he did 
not care for the company of my own precious <unk> I now felt it wiser 
to keep <unk> in school and- during the <unk> at a camp 
run by the Society of <unk> all year around. Her presence only 
made Letch more distant and <unk> and, in the hurry of buying <unk> <unk> I had neglected to consider a room for <unk> 
so there was no place to put her, <unk> (I sometimes feel that God, 
in His infinite wisdom, <unk> us to have these <unk> little <unk> of memory. It almost always works out for the <unk> I <unk> this man, Letch <unk> why, I cannot say. With <unk> 
heart and a brave smile, I endured his long <unk> from <unk> <unk> his <unk> his <unk> his <unk> and his <unk> 
The times I can recall when I was publicly <unk> by him- lovely 
dinner parties in our <unk> <unk> where the <unk> was postponed 
and postponed and <unk> only to be served dry and <unk> 
at a table where the <unk> chair was <unk> a <unk> <unk> 
at the new pool, which I had built in the hope of keeping Letch 
away from public <unk> when Letch and a certain <unk> stayed <unk> together for the better part of an <unk> a lovely <unk> 
party at <unk> <unk> on which sacred occasion Letch stole 
away with an unknown <unk> leaving me <unk> and <unk> to 
get home as best I could. These are but a sampling of the <unk> I <unk> As Mrs& Letch <unk> was it any wonder that I, once <unk> social <unk> of <unk> was excluded from the smart <unk> 
given by the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> 
the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> and such <unk> closely <unk> families as the <unk> and the <unk> As <unk> <unk> conduct increased, our invitations <unk> and my heart 
was in my mouth whenever I played hostess at a fashionable <unk> <unk>   Between <unk> and <unk> Letch and I made ten <unk> together, each less successful, both <unk> and <unk> 
than the one before it. Our last joint <unk> <unk> <unk> 
a deeply religious film based on the life of Mother <unk> and <unk> so that its release date would coincide with the <unk> 
of America's first <unk> in November, <unk> was a <unk> from start 
to <unk> As I was playing Mother <unk> the picture was actually <unk> <unk> with nearly every scene built around me. But in 
order to keep Letch in the public eye and out of trouble, I wrote 
in a part especially for him- that of a <unk> <unk> who <unk> 
the <unk> and is saved by the inspiring example of Mother <unk> 
And did he appreciate my efforts on his <unk> Did he trouble to <unk> the very small part which I had <unk> to his <unk> 
a role eventually cut down to three short <unk> Did 
he show the rest of the <unk> numbering four <unk> the consideration 
of arriving at the studio <unk> or even at <unk> <unk> 
did <unk> The <unk> went on for eight <unk> Most 
of our working days were spent on the telephone calling <unk> <unk> gambling <unk> a certain <unk> club for young <unk> 
more than a hundred different bars or the steam room of the <unk> club. Whenever he <unk> to appear at the studio he was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> He made many <unk> <unk> and <unk> remarks, not only about me in the title <unk> but about religion in general. By the time the film was released 
we were three million dollars <unk> war was <unk> and the 
public apparently had forgotten all about Mother <unk> Thanks to <unk> <unk> and the terrible strain he imposed on me, the notices 
were few and <unk> Only George <unk> seemed to understand 
and appreciate the film when he wrote: "Miss <unk> has <unk> 
the most eloquent argument for the Protestant faith yet <unk> 
by <unk> But it was small <unk>   In a rare <unk> of anger and <unk> I <unk> out" my own husband to a small 
and most <unk> studio to make one picture as a form of <unk> <unk> actor must have <unk> The film was called <The <unk> of <unk> which I felt was just what Letch <unk> It 
turned out to be a life of Martin <unk> of all <unk> It was 
a <unk> In clothes, Letch simply did not project. He was laughed 
off the screen. At the same time, however, I <unk> myself of the 
services of that great English actor and master of <unk> Sir <unk> <unk> to do a <unk> called <The <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in which I played a young American girl who <unk> 
a haunted <unk> on the English <unk> which is filled with secret passages 
and sliding panels and, <unk> to anyone, is still occupied 
by an eccentric <unk> It was a <unk> made on a <unk> 
and not the sort of film I like, as all I had to do was look <unk> and scream a great deal. My heart was not in it, but, <unk> <unk> it remains the most financially successful picture of my career. <unk> watched it on television late one night last week and it <unk> <unk> remarkably well, even twenty years <unk>   Letch had 
returned from his <unk> <unk> and more badly behaved than <unk> I really loved that boy, and, in a <unk> attempt to preserve 
our marriage and to try to revive the wonderful, wonderful person <unk> had once been, I took my troubles to <unk> hoping that her <unk> <unk> would help me.   "If I could only think of something 
at the <unk> near me, to absorb his <unk> <unk> I said. 
"What is Letch interested <unk>   <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> said <unk>   Her reply <unk> me, but this 
was too important to let my hurt make any difference. "I can't turn 
the studio into a gambling hell or a <unk> I <unk> to date, however, his garden was still more or less of a <unk> 
he hadn't even started his workshop and if there was a meadow pond 
in the neighborhood he hadn't found it.   It wasn't his fault 
that these things were so. The difficulty was that each day seemed 
to produce its <unk> of details which must be cleaned up <unk> a result, life had become a kind of continuous <unk> 
Once he disposed of these items which screamed so <unk> for attention, 
he could undertake the things which really <unk> Then, at last, 
his day would fall into an ordered pattern and he would be free to <unk> or garden or just <unk> through the woods in the late afternoon, <unk> by his dogs.   His <unk> He had almost forgotten 
them, although they had played such an important part in his early <unk> Then they had always been <unk> around him on these <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> off into the bushes on <unk> hunting <unk> returning to jump up on him <unk> with muddy <unk> <unk> did something to one's <unk> They were constantly assuring 
you that you were one of the world's great <unk> <unk> of how 
much of a <unk> you knew yourself to be, you could be certain they would 
never find out- and even if they did it would make no <unk> it became increasingly apparent that there were to be no dogs 
in the picture. What in the world were you going to do with a lot 
of dogs when you left for town on Monday <unk> You certainly 
couldn't take them into the little apartment and if you tried to farm 
them out for two or three days every week they would become so confused 
that they would have nervous <unk> Why in the world couldn't 
he live in one place the way everyone else seemed <unk>   It <unk> him, this inability to get the simplest things done in the course 
of a day. He would wake up in the middle of the night and <unk> about 
it. How in the world had he formerly found time to build up a business, <unk> a family, be on half a dozen <unk> work actively on committees 
and either go out in the evening or plow through the contents 
of a <unk> brief <unk>   Was it possible that as people grow 
older the nature of time <unk> Could it be that it <unk> up for 
the aged in some mysterious way, as if a bored universe were <unk> 
through the end of the chapter just to get it over <unk> Or was 
the answer less <unk> Did older people work more <unk> <unk> it take a man of sixty-five longer to write a letter, <unk> clean 
out a barn, read a newspaper, than a man of <unk> Did men become <unk> as they grew older, <unk> <unk> reluctant to 
let <unk>   It might be that certain people were born with a compulsion 
to <unk> their lives, while others could live <unk> <unk> almost <unk> like <unk> in the sun, too <unk> 
to <unk> their eyes. Perhaps it was his <unk> or good <unk> <unk> way one looked at it, to belong to the former group, and he 
was struggling unconsciously to build up pressure in a world which demanded <unk> which was positively <unk> to it.   And then 
again perhaps the reason why he couldn't find time to do any of the 
things he had planned to do after <unk> reading, <unk> <unk> <unk> on his back and watching the clouds go by, was because 
he didn't want to do them. There was no compulsion behind them. They 
could be done or left <unk> and nobody really gave a <unk> During 
all his busy life he had only done things which had to be done. This <unk> had become so fixed over the years that it seemed futile to do 
anything for which no one was waiting.   He looked at the luminous <unk> of his <unk> watch. It was five minutes after <unk> On some <unk> farm a <unk> <unk> and, far down the valley, an associate answered. 
He turned over <unk> and pulled the sheet over his head 
against the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> THE equipment for his <unk> Thus <unk> action 
might follow. He went down to Mills and <unk> <unk> <unk> 
and bought a full set of <unk> tools, including a <unk> 
power saw and several other pieces of power machinery that Mr& Mills 
said were essential for <unk> and <unk> whatever <unk> <unk> He also bought a huge square of pegboard for hanging up his tools, 
and lumber for his <unk> <unk> and glue and <unk> <unk> 
levels and ~T squares and <unk> lines and several <unk> that he 
had 
no idea how to use or what they were for.   <unk> said 
Mr& <unk> <unk> get you started. Best not to get everything 
at once. Add things as you find you need <unk>   He didn't 
even ask the cost of this collection. After all, if you were going 
to set up a workshop you had to have the proper equipment and that 
was that. When he returned home, the station wagon loaded with tools, <unk> had gone with a friend to some meeting in the <unk> using 
the recently purchased second car. He was <unk> It gave him a chance 
to unload the stuff and get it down to the cellar without a <unk> 
of acid comments. He had made such a <unk> about buying that second car 
that he knew he was <unk>   He piled everything neatly in 
a corner of the cellar and turned to stare at the blank stone wall. 
That was where the pegboard would go on which he would hang his hand <unk> In front of it would be his <unk>   The old <unk> 
which had caused him so many <unk> hours came charging in on him 
once more, only this time he couldn't <unk> it with a sleeping <unk> 
and 
send it away. How in the world did one attach a pegboard to a stone <unk> 
How did one attach anything to a stone wall, for that <unk> 
After the pegboard there would be the <unk> He sat down on an 
old box and focused on the problem. Perhaps one bored holes in the stone 
with some kind of an electric <unk> But then, when you stuck things 
into the <unk> why didn't they come right out <unk> It all 
seemed rather <unk>   He turned his attention to the <unk> 
Perhaps that was the first thing to do. A <unk> had a heavy 
top and sturdy legs, but how did you attach sturdy legs to a heavy top 
so that the whole thing didn't <unk> like a newborn <unk> and ultimately <unk> when you leaned on it?   Mr& Mills had done 
some figuring on a scrap of paper and given him the various kinds of <unk> and <unk> which, properly <unk> would, he had assured 
him, turn into a <unk> They lay on the cellar floor in a <unk> <unk> Mr& Crombie <unk> at it <unk> with his <unk> How could 
anyone know what to do with an <unk> like that? Perhaps he 
had better have someone help him put up the pegboard and build the <unk> 
someone who knew what he was about. Then at least he would 
have a place to hang his tools and something to work on. After that 
everything should be <unk>   He went upstairs to phone <unk> 
To his <unk> he reached him. Mr& <unk> was laid up with a 
bad cold. He didn't seem to think that <unk> a pegboard to a stone 
wall was much of a problem and he tossed off the building of the <unk> <unk> <unk> The only trouble was that he himself was tied 
up on the school job. That was why he hadn't been able to finish 
the porch. No, he didn't know of any <unk> There 
wasn't any such thing any more. <unk> all wanted steady work and 
at the moment every mother's son for twenty miles around that could <unk> nails for twenty-five dollars a day was working on the school <unk>   There was a fellow named Blatz over <unk> way. Nobody 
liked to hire him because you never could tell when he was going 
to be taken drunk. Mr& <unk> would probably see him at Lodge <unk> 
the next night. If he was <unk> which was <unk> he'd have 
him get in touch with Mr& <unk>   Mr& Blatz had been 
at least sober enough to remember to telephone and he turned out to 
be the greatest <unk> that had come into Mr& <unk> life since 
he moved to <unk> in spite of the fact that he didn't work very <unk> or very long at a time, and he didn't like to work at all unless 
Mr& Crombie hung around and talked to him. He said he was the lonely 
type and working in a cellar you saw funny things coming out of 
the cracks in the wall if they wasn't nobody with you. So Mr& Crombie 
sat on a wooden box and talked in order to keep Mr& <unk> 
mind from funny things. At the same time he watched carefully to see 
how one attached <unk> to stone walls, but Mr& Blatz was usually 
standing in his line of vision and it all seemed so simple that he 
didn't like to <unk> his <unk>   While Mr& Blatz 
was putting up the <unk> and starting the <unk> Mr& Crombie 
told him of this idea about <unk> the whole end of the <unk> 
Mr& Blatz agreed that this would be <unk> Without further discussion 
he appeared the next morning with a pile of boards sticking over 
the end of his light truck and proceeded with the <unk> which he 
then stained and <unk> according to his taste.   <unk> he said, <unk> got to put in some <unk> for them power <unk> then a couple 
of <unk> <unk> over the <unk> an' I guess we're about 
through down here".   It all did look very efficient and <unk> There was no question of that. "By the <unk> said Mr& <unk> packing his tools into a battered <unk> <unk> power tools 
needs extra <unk> I guess you know about that. Before you use <unk> the light company's got to run in a heavy line and you'll need 
a new <unk> box for the extra <unk> That ain't too bad <unk> 
the light company's so busy you can't ever get 'em to do <unk>   Instead of being depressed by this news, Mr& <unk> was actually <unk> At least the moment was postponed when 
he had to face the mystery of the power tools. He followed Mr& <unk> up the cellar stairs. As usual, Mrs& Crombie was standing 
in the midst of a confusion of cooking <unk> Mr& Blatz sat down 
in the only <unk> kitchen chair.   "Well", he said, <unk> 
your man fixed up nice down there. He <unk> be able to build a 
new house with all them <unk> Mr& Crombie watched his 
wife with an anxious expression. "I was just <unk> to him that I'm 
all ready now for anything else you want <unk> Mr& Crombie 
couldn't remember his saying any such thing.   "Oh, that's <unk> cried Mrs& <unk> "I have a thousand things 
for you to do. <unk> that won't open, and doors that won't close 
and shelves and broken **h"   "But those are the things I built 
the <unk> <unk> protested Mr& <unk> <unk> are 
the things <I> can do, now that I'm set up".   "I've 
been waiting to get these things done for <unk> she said. "We <unk> live long enough if I wait for you, besides which you don't 
need to <unk> <unk> be plenty more". But the discussion was <unk> Mr& Blatz was already taking measurements for a shelf 
above the kitchen <unk> <unk> in English has been <unk> as much as the <unk> use of words, unless it be the ambiguous use of <unk> <unk> Franklin said, <unk> <unk> Mr& <unk> You explain English 
by <unk> Richard <unk> <unk> said, "I think the <unk> is the hardest to be understood of the <unk> And a witty 
American journalist remarked over a century ago what is even more 
true today, <unk> a writer seems to think he is never profound except 
when he can't understand his own <unk>   There are many 
types of <unk> and many of them have been described by <unk> 
under such names as <unk> <unk> and other <unk> 
In common <unk> they would be described as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>   One species 
of <unk> tries to <unk> by <unk> <unk> "Did 
you or did you not say what I said you said, because Jane said you 
never said what I <unk>   Another woman, addressing Christmas <unk> said to her <unk> "We sent them one last year but 
they didn't send us one, so they probably won't send us one this 
year because they'll think we won't send them one because they didn't 
last year, don't you think, or shall <unk>   Such ambiguous <unk> compound confusion by making it worse <unk> and 
they are sometimes expanded until the cream of the <unk> <unk> <unk> 
of a <unk> kind describes the dilemma one girl found herself 
in. "I'm terribly <unk> she told a <unk> "I wrote <unk> in my last letter to forget that I had told him that I didn't 
mean to <unk> my decision not to change my mind- and he 
seems to have misunderstood me". <unk> Bill was another of those 
men who simply don't understand women.   Another case involves 
a newspaper reporter who <unk> up a <unk> "Mr& Jones, 
you may recall that we printed last week your denial of having <unk> 
the contradiction of your original statement. Now would you care 
to have us say that you were <unk> in regard to it"?   Questions 
like this, framed in verbal fog, are perhaps the only kind that 
have ever <unk> an experienced <unk> They recall <unk> <unk> <unk> "I wish he would explain his <unk> <unk> when a reporter once questioned Lincoln in <unk> fashion, <unk> refused to make any further statement. "I fear explanations <unk> of things <unk> he said, leaving the <unk> <unk> 
and <unk>   The <unk> of politicians may not always be 
as innocent as it <unk> <unk> said an <unk> <unk> <unk> can't understand from your speech last night just how 
you stand on the <unk> <unk> replied the <unk> "It 
took me five hours to write it that way".   The <unk> <unk> is another species more honored in the <unk> of <unk> 
than in the <unk> This creates an amusing effect because its 
position in a sentence seems to make it apply to the wrong word. A verse 
familiar to all <unk> is the <unk> "I saw a man once 
beat 
his wife When on a <unk> <unk> Now can you tell me who was <unk> The man, his wife, or me"?   The <unk> <unk> of <unk> another <unk> of this sort, had endless <unk> a man outside with a wooden leg named <unk> <unk> the name of his other <unk>   Another 
stock <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is home sick in bed with the <unk>   When radio came in, it continued the misplaced <unk> 
in its <unk> as a standard device.   <unk> you see that 
pretty girl standing next to the car with <unk> <unk> "I see 
the girl but I don't see the car with <unk> <unk>   In 
recent years <unk> have discovered this brand of <unk> and thus 
the misplaced <unk> has acquired a new habitat in the <unk> 
In one <unk> a family is shown outside a theater with the head of the 
family addressing the <unk> <unk> me, but when we came out 
we found that we had left my <unk> <unk> and my wife's <unk> supplies us with an endless run of such <unk> 
Not long ago a newspaper advised those taking part in a contest 
that <unk> must be of a person not larger than **f <unk> ads are also <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> are familiar with such 
items which often appear in its lists of verbal <unk> like the ad in 
a California paper that advertised <unk> for <unk> <unk> takes in 
five counties, two <unk>   Since <unk> is the soul of <unk> as well as <unk> newspaper <unk> continually provide 
us with amusing <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> Many <unk> 
in <unk> Son and <unk> of Local <unk> <unk> from misplaced <unk> and <unk> journalism contributes 
a wide variety of comic ambiguities in both editorial and advertising <unk>   A weekly newspaper reported a local <unk> 
"**h and the couple were married last Saturday, thus ending a friendship 
which began in their <unk>   An item in the letters 
column of a newspaper renewed a <unk> <unk> "I personally <unk> your newspaper as much as my <unk>   Then there 
was the <unk> ad which <unk> <unk> YOU <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> AN <unk> We have complete facilities to accommodate <unk> people".   The newspaper too is the favorite habitat of the <unk> This slip is so-called because its <unk>

means what it seems to say. <unk> He walked in upon her <unk>

or head than in the <unk> <unk> Henry Morgan was <unk> 
Miss <unk> Green from the church social last Saturday night, a savage <unk> attacked them and bit Mr& Morgan on the public <unk> items recall the California journalist who reported an <unk> involving a movie <unk> "The area in which Miss <unk> was <unk> is <unk> <unk>   The double meaning in the <unk> made it a familiar <unk> device, as in the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> When a witness at court was asked if he had been <unk> in the <unk> <unk> he replied, "No, it was in the <unk> <unk> enough, this always brought the house down.   Apart 
from <unk> and <unk> <unk> the anatomical is also found

But since the <unk> insisted that it is done that way at the most <unk> <unk> the girl <unk> agreed. So she brought the <unk> in whole, and she carried a lemon in her mouth.   Another <unk> of such <unk> is illustrated by a woman in a department <unk> She said to the <unk> "I want a dress to put on

look here, <unk> I know you got to entertain these kids and all. 
But this is a public park and it's a city ordinance that the <unk> 
cannot be crawled <unk>   Arlene was so ashamed that she hung 
her head when she said, "Yes, sir".   The policeman walked 
on, but he looked back once.   That had happened on the day when 
two 
other unusual things had occurred. Arlene had taught them a new way 
to have fun in their little private <unk> and they had told their 
mother about the <unk> In matters of exact information, that kept 
her one step behind <unk> and so they were consistently true 
to their <unk>   <unk> <unk> Arlene had said, after 
the policeman had left, having pursued the usual <unk> course 
of <unk> <unk> mind. I know something that is much more fun 
that we can do on our little <unk>   "What is it"? asked 
the children, whose <unk> and replies were invariably so <unk> 
normal and <unk> Maybe that was why they were <unk> and <unk> towards the <unk> of <unk>   "Just you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the dialogue in a recent British <unk> when they had got to their little <unk> they had had a most <unk> magnificent time. First, Arlene had put them through 
some rapid <unk> They had protested that <unk> wasn't any <unk>   "Just you <unk> said Arlene again, as though 
she were discovering the pleasantly <unk> <unk> of that handy 
little sturdy statement. "This is a <unk>   "Is it 
anything like <unk> <unk> asked one of the <unk> the least <unk> Arlene snapped. One of the many things 
that was so nice about her was that she always took your questions <unk> 
particularly your <unk> very serious questions. Those were 
especially the ones that all other <unk> laughed at <unk> She would 
sometimes even get a little hard on you, she took you so <unk> 
But not hard for very long. Just long enough to make you feel <unk> said <unk> <unk> making them both 
sit in formation on a big root of a live <unk> the sort of root that divided 
itself and made their <unk> <unk> down and feel comfortable. "Now, <unk> going to be like what General <unk> and his horse make 
us think <unk>   The children looked at each other and <unk> their <unk> down even more comfortably than ever. Their curiosity 
went happily out of <unk>   Then, Arlene threw herself <unk> and <unk> in a way that was just <unk> She held herself 
that way and turned her head towards them and laughed and <unk> <unk> being able to laugh and <unk> when you're like the top part 
of that picture frame at <unk> one of them said. They both laughed 
and winked back.   "I'm General <unk> horse, upside <unk> Arlene said, sort of <unk> for <unk> even she had 
to breathe kind of funny when she was in that position. She made General <unk> <unk> belly do so funny when it was upside down. <unk> she was back on her feet, winking and smiling that enormous <unk> <unk> had lots of wonderful big teeth that you never would have suspected 
she had when she was not <unk> And she would <unk> and throw <unk> They both tried to keep smiling and winking for a long time, 
but it made <unk> lips and <unk> <unk> But they kept on <unk> for a long, long time.   "This time", Arlene said, 
and she even kept on <unk> a little bit while she was just <unk> <unk> going to tell me what I am and what I'm doing. It 
all has something to do with General <unk> and his <unk> time, it was so <unk> they could tell exactly what it was. 
It was General <unk> horse running in a circle. His legs <unk> and the shaking went right on up his body through his <unk> to 
his shoulders. "That's the <unk> <unk> one of them cried 
out.   The other <unk> in a happy laughter, "That's 
a funny old <unk>   The first one said, "He sure does <unk> <unk> <unk>   Then there was the General <unk> his <unk> They had to be told that one. But it was even <unk> after 
they had been <unk> Their father, when he came back from those many 
business <unk> just <unk> their mother on the forehead with his lips 
and asked if anybody had thought to mix the <unk> and put them in 
the electric <unk> But not General <unk> He was the <unk> 
man. He never could keep still, even when he didn't move his <unk> <unk> had to get up and be General <unk> Or his <unk> All they could think of was to run around in <unk> kicking 
their legs out. It wasn't very <unk> Then, they said General <unk> was going to jump over his <unk> <unk> and they did some <unk> But that wasn't very funny, either.   "You <unk> to <unk> Arlene advised them. And Arlene showed them how 
to <unk> She also taught them to sing "I wish I could <unk> like 
my sister <unk> That helped a lot. They were <unk> but they 
were beginning to catch on. They also caught on a little bit on how to <unk> a lot without your lips trembling. <unk> you won't get 
your allowance if you're caught not <unk> or smiling with your <unk> trembling too much", Arlene suggested.   That helped a 
great deal. <unk> were a little late in getting home.   "I'm <unk> Mrs& <unk> Arlene said in a tone so low you could 
hardly hear it.   My mother constituted herself the voice 
of all of us. "It's perfectly <unk> <unk> my mother 
said in a friendly way. "I suppose you all were playing and <unk> <unk> the children <unk> <unk> couldn't help <unk>   The children rushed off to 
get rid of their <unk> and Arlene began <unk> the kitchen door <unk> <unk> a good <unk> my uncle remarked to <unk> but 
he said it too soon, for it came out just before the tap to which the 
door <unk> That tap had a slight <unk> quality.   "She 
really is a dear little thing", my mother agreed. Her upper lip <unk> <unk> She was <unk> into a small red <unk> and that action 
always caused her to lift her lip from the <unk> of the thing. Also, 
she lived in <unk> fear of finding a white <unk> curled up in 
a <unk> mean little heap at the white center of the <unk> She would 
try to see over the <unk> of her <unk> and somewhat under her teeth 
to the place where she was <unk> It never <unk> <unk> but 
it made her look <unk> Also, when she had <unk> off half of the small <unk> she found the <unk> <unk> and she would <unk> 
the <unk> half of the <unk> out to where she could inspect it. 
One could hear a very <unk> <unk> sigh of relief. Actually, it 
was <unk> to anyone not expecting it. But the warm joy of her brown 
eyes was open to the general public.   Later on, the children 
told her further about <unk> "It must be <unk> good 
for them. And <unk> kind of <unk> she told us later. "But 
do you know something <unk> she added. "I reached into 
that funny little pocket that is high up on my dress. I have no notion 
why I <unk> And I found a <unk> Was it an <unk> I thought 
for a second. But I would not <unk> myself in that silly way. 
I opened the window and threw the <unk> out".   Then, my mother <unk> at this small <unk> for she knew and we knew that it was <unk> that had made one more <unk> that night just too impossible 
a <unk> <unk> became <unk> nobody could have 
told why. But she was. It was in the air.   A friend of my father's 
came to dinner. He was passing through town and <unk> to say <unk> As a result, he was persuaded out to dinner. As a matter of 
fact, this happened every four or five months. <unk> he coincided 
with my father's being at home. <unk> as at this <unk> he 
did not. But he was always persuaded out.   he liked children, 
in a <unk> kind of <unk> the two youngest in our family always had 
to be 
brought in and put through <unk> for his <unk> When he 
had left, I could never remember whether he had <unk> them in their <unk> <unk> with a thick index finger or whether he was merely 
so much the sort of person who did this that one assumed the action, 
not <unk> to look. The children <unk> him, too.   This evening, 
they were pushed in from the breakfast room, with odds and ends 
of <unk> distributed over them. There had been some <unk> in it, 
for I remember my mother's taking a quick glance at a <unk> bit 
of this nut on the cheek of one of them and then putting down her <unk> 
with a <unk>   They were pushed gently into the room by <unk> 
whose only part appearing were hands that crept quickly back 
around to the kitchen side of the door. We had just sat down. <unk> Mr& <unk> what you're doing these <unk> my mother <unk> the children, <unk>   There was an air of revolt 
about the <unk> even <unk> for their own <unk> This 
could be told chiefly from a sort of <unk> and <unk> a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> 
had brought up bitter problems of administration. But, at the beginning, 
this stayed just in the air.   "We go to the park with

"You don't step on the flowers, do you? <unk>   One

to what <unk> another <unk> who <unk> with our <unk> A couple 
of years back, I occupied a Village apartment whose outer <unk> 
contained the type of <unk> called a <unk> <unk> In it was 
a stone <unk> Buddha I had picked up in <unk> and <unk> 
to make <unk> my wife and I <unk> it with flowers or laid a 
few <unk> in its lap. After a while, we became aware that the money 
was <unk> as fast as we <unk> it. Our suspicions eventually <unk> by the process of <unk> on a <unk> boy, a <unk> bad hat, who delivered <unk> to the people <unk> The 
more I <unk> into this young man's activities and character, the 
less <unk> I found him. I learned, for example, that he made a practice 
of <unk> at dogs he encountered and, in winter, of sprinkling <unk> on the icy <unk> to <unk> their feet. His energy was <unk> 
sometimes he would be up before <unk> clad as a <unk> <unk> 
and <unk> <unk> into <unk> to <unk> us, and thereafter would <unk> to the Bronx <unk> to <unk> at the <unk> and press cigar <unk> against their <unk> <unk> he was frequently to be seen at restaurants 
like <unk> + <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ladies' hats and singing <unk> <unk> <unk> In short, 
and to borrow an <unk> phrase, <unk> <unk> Well, the <unk> little <unk> went along <unk> animals and humans who couldn't <unk> 
and in due course, as was <unk> <unk> himself. One morning, 
we discovered not only that the <unk> were missing from the <unk> but that a cigarette had been <unk> out in its lap. "Now he's <unk> it", said my wife <unk> "No <unk> will hold 
still for that. He's really asking for it". And how right she was. 
The next time we saw him, he was a changed <unk> he had aged <unk> years, and his face, the color of <unk> was <unk> with <unk> 
as though it had been wrapped in chicken <unk> Some sort of <unk> was haunting his <unk> he told us in a <unk> <unk> 
either an <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> a <unk> we couldn't 
determine <unk> His eyes had the same dreadful rigid stare as Dr& <unk> <unk> when he was found before his open safe wearing 
the <unk> <unk> The grocery the youth worked for soon tired 
of his <unk> effect on customers, most of whom were sufficiently <unk> without the threat of <unk> and let him go. The beautiful, 
the satisfying part of his <unk> however, was the <unk> 
way the Buddha polished him off. <unk> to <unk> he at last got 
a job as office boy to a television <unk> His <unk> deficiency 
of taste, and <unk> carried him <unk> to the top. He evolved 
programs that <unk> new depths of <unk> and <unk> whole <unk>

looks at it, therefore, I'd say that your <unk> for this autumn 
is the reverse of <unk> The inventory you acquired from me isn't 
going to be easy to <unk> you can't very well <unk> up to people 
on the street and ask if they want to buy a hot <unk> <unk> 
since you're going to be <unk> de <unk> pretty soon with <unk> <unk> Delhi <unk> the <unk> <unk> liver <unk> <unk> 
and a host of other <unk> of the <unk> you've <unk> you <unk> expect to be <unk> <unk> My advice, if you live long 
enough to continue your <unk> is that the next time you're attracted 
by the <unk> pass it up- it's nothing but a <unk> As 
you can count on me to do the same.   <unk> <unk> J& <unk> <unk> IN THE <unk> <unk>

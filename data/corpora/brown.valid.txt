David <unk> had certain <unk> <unk> that this rebellion

and made a big scene about <unk> trying to take her husband 
away. That finished me with <unk> <unk> Eileen to squeeze all the <unk> out of a situation.   And there I was <unk> up with Eileen 
in that filthy fourth floor attic on Hudson Street. I use the <unk> <unk> because there was something positively <unk> about 
our relationship. I felt it and it ate on me all the time, but I 
didn't know how right I was till later.   What I did know was 
that <unk> was always around. He slept in the hall bedroom at the 
head of the stairs. "Who do you think pays the <unk> You wouldn't 
have me throw the poor boy out on the <unk> Eileen said when 
I <unk> her about it. I said sure that was what I wanted her 
to do but she paid no attention. Eileen had a wonderful way of not listening 
to things she didn't want to hear. Still I didn't think 
she was <unk> me with <unk> right then. To be on the safe side 
I never let Eileen get out of my sight day or night.   <unk> 
had me <unk> I couldn't make out what his <unk> was. I'd 
thought him a <unk> or <unk> but he didn't seem to be. He was smooth 
and civil spoken but it seemed to me there was something tough under 
his <unk> manner. Still he let Eileen treat him like a <unk> <unk> the place was cleaned or a meal served it was <unk> 
who did the work.   I never could find out what his business was. 
He always seemed to have money in his pocket. The phone had been <unk> but <unk> came for him and notes by special <unk> 
Now and then he would disappear for several days. <unk> 
was all he would say with that smooth hurt smile when I put leading <unk> "Oh he's just an international <unk> Eileen would <unk> with her <unk> <unk>   Poor devil he can't have been 
too happy either. He got no relief from drink because, though sometimes <unk> would buy himself a drink if he went out with us in the <unk> he'd leave it on the table <unk>   When I was in <unk> I rode him pretty hard I <unk> Occasionally if I pushed 
him too far he'd give me a look out of narrowed eyes and the hard cruel <unk> <unk> would show through that smooth face of his. "Some day", 
I told <unk> "that guy will kill us <unk> She just wouldn't <unk>   Getting drunk every night was the only way I 
could handle the situation. Eileen seemed to feel the same way. We still 
had that much in <unk> The trouble was drinking cost money. The 
way Eileen and I were hitting it up, we needed ten or fifteen dollars 
an evening. Eileen must have <unk> a little out of <unk> 
I raised some <unk> by <unk> the good clothes I had left over from 
my respectable <unk> life, but when that was gone I didn't have a <unk> I don't know what we would have done if Pat <unk> hadn't 
come to town.   Pat <unk> looked like a heavier <unk> 
He had the same bullet head of <unk> <unk> hair but he didn't have <unk> <unk> humor or his brains or his charm. He was a big <unk> <unk> violent man. Now Pat may have been a <unk> and a <unk> 
but he was a good <unk> Catholic and he loved his little <unk> Those <unk> had that Irish <unk> that made them <unk> 
together in spite of politics and everything.   Pat took Eileen 
and me out to dinner at a <unk> <unk> house and told us with tears 
in his eyes how happy he was we had come together again. <unk> God <unk> <unk> <unk> The <unk> were real religious people 
except for <unk> Now it would be up to me to keep the little girl 
out of <unk> Pat had been worried as hell ever since she'd lost 
her job on that fashion <unk> It had gone big with the Hollywood 
girls when he told them his sister was an editor of <unk> and <unk> 
How about me trying to help her get her job <unk>   All <unk> Eileen had been as <unk> as a little girl getting ready 
for her first <unk> It just about blew us both out of the water 
when Eileen suddenly came out with what she came out with. "But brother 
I can't take a job right now", she said with her eyes on her <unk> cream, "I'm going to have a baby, Francis <unk> baby, 
my own husband's <unk>   My first thought was how had it 
happened so soon, but I counted back on my fingers and sure enough we'd 
been living together six weeks. Pat meanwhile was <unk> over with <unk> <unk> thing that ever happened. Now Eileen really 
would have to settle down to love honor and <unk> and she'd have to <unk> <unk> He'd come East for the <unk> by God he would. 
When we separated that evening Pat pushed a hundred dollar bill 
into <unk> hand to help towards a <unk>   Before he left 
town Pat saw to it that I was fixed up with a job. Pat had contacts 
all over the labor movement. A friend of <unk> named Frank <unk> 
had just <unk> into the <unk> Union.   The <unk> 
were retired <unk> and small time <unk> off <unk> 
and <unk> who acted as <unk> on the <unk> Most of them were <unk> men. It was responsible and sometimes dangerous work because 
the <unk> is awful in the port of New York. They weren't as 
well paid as they should have been. One reason the <unk> let <unk> take them over was to get the protection of his <unk> needed a front, some labor stiff with a clean record to 
act as business agent of the <unk> <unk> There I was a retired <unk> and structural iron worker who'd never <unk> a cent off a fellow <unk> in my thirty years in the movement. For once <unk> was 
a <unk>   <unk> couldn't wait to get me <unk> 
With my gray hair and my <unk> <unk> I certainly looked 
the honest working <unk> The things a man will do for a woman. 
There was one fact which Rector could not <unk> one truth which 
he could not <unk> As long as there were two human beings working together 
on the same project, there would be competition and you could no 
more escape it than you could expect to escape the <unk> No matter 
how devoted a man was, no matter how fully he gave his life to the Lord, 
he could never <unk> that one spark of pride that gave him definition 
as an individual. All of the jobs in the mission might be equal 
in the eyes of the Lord, but they were certainly not equal in the 
eyes of the Lord's <unk> It was only natural that Fletcher would <unk> for a position in which he could make the <unk> Rector himself was <unk> to this spirit of competition and he 
knew it, not for a more exalted office in the hierarchy of the <unk> 
his ambitions for the <unk> had died very early in his <unk> 
but for the one clear victory he had talked about to the <unk> He 
was not sure how much of this desire was due to his devotion to the church 
and how much was his own <unk> demanding to be satisfied, for the two 
were <unk> and could not be <unk> He wanted desperately 
to see Kayabashi <unk> the Communists in the village rooted out, 
the mission standing <unk> for in the triumph of the Lord he 
himself would be <unk> too. But perhaps this was a part of the <unk> plan, that man's ambition when linked with God would be a <unk> <unk> force for good in the world.   He sighed. 
How foolish it was to try to <unk> the truth in an area where only faith 
would <unk> He would have to work without questioning the motives 
which made him work and content himself with the thought that the <unk> victory, however it was brought about, would be sweet <unk> first move was to send Hino to the village to spend a few days. 
His arm had been giving him some trouble and Rector was not enough 
of a medical expert to determine whether it had healed <unk> or 
whether Hino was simply <unk> against the <unk> work in the print <unk> using the <unk> in his arm as an <unk> In any event Rector 
sent him to the local hospital to have it <unk> telling him to 
keep his ears open while he was in the village to see if he could find 
out what Kayabashi was planning.   Hino was <unk> at the <unk> 
He was allowed to spend his nights at an <unk> near the hospital 
and he was given some extra money to go to the <unk> <unk> 
an excellent place to make contact with the enemy. He left with all 
the <unk> spirit of a child going on a holiday, nodding <unk> 
as Rector gave him his final <unk> He was to get involved in 
no <unk> he was to try to make no <unk> he was simply to listen 
and report back what he heard.   It was a ridiculous situation 
and Rector knew it, for <unk> frankly <unk> openly <unk> 
would make a poor <unk> agent. If he wanted to know anything, he 
would end up asking about it <unk> but in this <unk> manner 
he would probably receive more <unk> answers than if he tried to 
get them by <unk> In all of his experience in the mission field <unk> had never seen a convert quite like <unk> From the moment 
that Hino had first walked into the mission to ask for a job, any <unk> 
his qualifications neatly written on a piece of paper in a precise <unk> he had been ready to become a Christian. He had already been <unk> the <unk> he knew the <unk> and after studying 
with Fletcher for a time he approached <unk> announced that he wanted 
to be baptized and that was that.   Rector had never been able 
to find out much about <unk> past. Hino talked very little about 
himself except for the <unk> times when he used a personal illustration 
in connection with another subject. <unk> the pieces of 
this <unk> together, Rector had the vague outlines of a <unk> Hino 
was the fourth son of an elderly farmer who lived on the <unk> in <unk> and divided his life between the land and the sea, <unk> 
the marginal <unk> on his small <unk> farm with seasonal employment 
on a fishing boat. Without exception <unk> brothers turned 
to either one or both of their father's <unk> but Hino showed 
a talent for neither and instead spent most of his time on the beach 
where he repaired <unk> and proved immensely popular as a <unk> 
He had gone into the Japanese <unk> had been trained as an officer, 
had participated in one or two <unk> he never went into detail <unk> his military <unk> and at the age of <unk> 
quite as a bolt out of the blue, he had walked into the mission as if 
he belonged here and had become a Christian. Rector was often <unk> 
often tempted to ask questions but he never did. If and when Hino 
decided to tell him about his experiences, he would do so <unk> had no doubt that Hino would come back from the village <unk> with information, ready to <unk> it with his customary <unk> <unk> <unk> with his active <unk> When the telephone <unk> on the day after Hino went down to the <unk> Rector had 
a hunch it would be Hino with some <unk> of information too important 
to wait until his return, for there were few <unk> in the village 
and the phone in <unk> office rarely rang unless it was important. 
He was surprised to find <unk> secretary on the other 
end of the line. He was even more startled when he heard what Kayabashi <unk> The <unk> was entertaining a group of <unk> the 
secretary said, businessmen from Tokyo for the most part, and Kayabashi <unk> to show them the mission. They had never seen one before 
and had expressed a curiosity about it.   <unk> Rector 
said. "I guess it will be all right. When would the <unk> like 
to bring his guests up here"?   "This <unk> the 
secretary said. "At three o'clock if it will be of convenience to 
you at that time".   "All right", Rector said. "I will 
be expecting them".   He was about to hang up the phone, but 
a note of <unk> in the <unk> voice left the conversation <unk> He had something more to say. "I beg to inquire if the back 
is now safe for <unk> he said.   Rector laughed despite <unk> <unk> the <unk> has been working on it", he said, 
then checked himself and added: "You can tell <unk> 
that the back road is in very good condition and will be quite safe for 
his party to <unk>   <unk> <unk> The secretary <unk> with relief and then the telephone clicked in <unk> <unk>   Rector had no idea why Kayabashi wanted to visit the mission. 
For the <unk> to make such a trip was either a sign of great <unk> or an indication of equally great confidence, and from all 
the available information it was probably the latter. Kayabashi must 
feel fairly certain of his victory in order to make a visit like this, 
a trip which could be so easily <unk> by the people in the <unk> 
At the same time, it was unlikely that any businessmen would spend 
a day in a Christian mission out of mere <unk> No, Kayabashi 
was bringing his associates here for a specific purpose and Rector 
would not be able to <unk> it until they <unk>   When he had 
given the call a few moments thought, he went into the kitchen to ask 
Mrs& <unk> to prepare tea and <unk> for the visitors, using 
the formal English <unk> and the silver tea service which had been <unk> to the mission, then he went outside to inspect the grounds. <unk> 
had a pile of <unk> near one side of the <unk> Rector asked 
him to move it for the time <unk> he wanted the mission compound 
to be <unk> <unk> A good initial impression would be important 
now. He went into the print shop, where Fletcher had just finished 
cleaning the press.   "How many pamphlets do we have in <unk> <unk> said.   "I should say about a hundred <unk> <unk> said. <unk>   "I would like to enact 
a little <unk> this <unk> Rector said, He explained about 
the visit and the effect he wished to <unk> the picture of a very busy <unk> He did not wish to <unk> Kayabashi <unk> just to display 
the mission activities in a <unk> and impressive manner. Fletcher <unk> as he listened to the instructions and said he would arrange 
the things Rector <unk>   <unk> next stop was at 
the <unk> where <unk> was monitoring a test. He beckoned to her 
from the door and she slipped quietly outside. He told her of the visitors 
and then of his plans. "How many children do you have present <unk> he said.   She looked back toward the <unk> <unk> she said. "No, only <unk> The little <unk> girl 
had to go home. She has a pretty bad <unk>   "I would 
like them to appear very busy today, not busy <unk> but <unk> <unk> 
full of life. I want to create the impression of a compound 
full of children. Do you think you can manage it"?   <unk> <unk> "I'll <unk>   As Rector was walking back toward 
the residential hall, Johnson came out of the basement and bounded up 
to him. The <unk> in the coffee house had done little to <unk> 
his spirits, but he was still a little wary around Rector for they 
had not yet discussed the incident. "I think I've fixed the pump 
so we won't have to worry about it for a long time", he said. "I've <unk> the gauge so that the pump cuts out before the water 
gets too <unk>   <unk> Rector said. He looked out over 
the <unk> of the <unk> It was going to take a lot of activity 
to fill it. "Have you ever operated a <unk> he <unk> <unk> Johnson said.   "You are about to become a <unk> <unk> Rector said. "When <unk> gets back with 
the <unk> I want you to round up two or three Japanese boys. <unk> 
can help you. You'll find an old transit in the <unk> The <unk> is out of it, but that won't matter. It looks pretty efficient 
and that's the important thing". He went on to explain what he 
had in mind. Johnson nodded. He said he could do it.   Rector 
was <unk> to his over-all strategy by the time he got back to the residential <unk> It was rather a childish game, all in all, but everybody 
seemed to be getting into the spirit of the thing and he could not 
remember when he had enjoyed planning anything quite so much. He was 
not sure what effect it would have, but that was really beside the point 
when you got right down to it. He was not going to lose the mission 
by <unk> and whatever reason Kayabashi had for bringing his little <unk> group to the mission, he was going to be in for a <unk> found Elizabeth in the parlor and asked her to make 
sure everything was in order in the residential hall, and then to take 
charge of the office while the party was here. When everything had been 
done, Rector went back to his desk to occupy himself with his monthly 
report until three o'clock.   At two thirty he sent <unk> 
to the top of the wall at the <unk> corner of the mission to 
keep an eye on the ridge road and give a signal when he first <unk> 
the approach of <unk> party. Then <unk> <unk> in his best 
blue <unk> suit, sat in a chair out on the <unk> in the shade of a <unk> <unk> a cigarette and waiting. The air was cooler here, and the <unk> pattern of the trees threw a <unk> shadow on the grass, an effect 
which he found <unk> concluded by asking him to name another hour should this one 
be <unk>   The fish took the <unk> He replied that he 
could not imagine what importance there might be in thus meeting with

and decided not to involve himself in a new <unk> She was told

at him, seeing only a body rigidly erect behind the <unk> <unk> won't be too long. If my pass is <unk> I may 
be a half hour.   The soldier answered in a <unk> muffled voice, 
his lips barely <unk> Watson turned away and did not see the man's <unk> <unk> and his body <unk>   <unk> sir.   He 
had acknowledged the man. It was easier to think now, Watson decided. 
The stiff figure in the corner no longer blocked his thoughts. He <unk> slowly, <unk> staring at the <unk> <unk> floor. He tried 
to order the words of the three Union officers, seeking to create some <unk> portrait of the dead boy. But he groped <unk> His lack

against the <unk> <unk> wall and let his mind <unk> A feeling of <unk> an <unk> of mind greater than any fatigue he had ever known, <unk> through him. What in the name of God was he doing, crouched 
in a <unk> pit on the wrong bank of the <unk> Why had he crossed 
the dark water, to bring back a group of <unk> soldiers or 
to <unk> in a <unk> <unk>   He grew annoyed and at the 
same time surprised at that emotion. He was conscious of a growing sense 
of <unk> <unk> had written it all out, hadn't <unk> Wasn't

voice was muffled again, <unk> with <unk> He clutched the <unk>

and stood for a second sucking in the cool air that smelled of mud 
and river <unk> To his left, the two <unk> <unk> their sharp <unk>

Union guards appeared, carrying their rifles at <unk> Watson stared 
at them <unk> They were <unk> men, well fed and <unk> with <unk> uniforms and sturdy <unk> Behind them <unk> a long column of <unk> <unk> men. The thin gray figures raised a <unk> <unk> cry 
like the call of a bird <unk> They moved toward the <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> Four men were knocked down, but 
did not attempt to <unk> They crept down the muddy slope toward the

The crawling men tried to rise and fell again. No one moved to them. <unk> watched two of them <unk> into the shallow water and listened 
to their voices beg <unk> In a <unk> <unk> and stumbling <unk> of bodies and lifting arms, the two men were dragged into the

like a <unk> his arms milling in slow circles. He paced forward <unk> <unk> too far back, his head tilted <unk> His steps were 
short and <unk> and, with his head thrown back, his progress was a <unk> <unk> He appeared to be peering <unk> down his nose 
at the crowded and <unk> vessel that would carry him to freedom. He <unk> into the water and fell heavily over the side of the <unk> <unk> his weight nearly <unk> the <unk> Watson looked for 
the fourth man. He had reached the three <unk> <unk> he crept 
in an <unk> manner, <unk> the ground before him. The guards did 
not look at him. The figure on the earth <unk> seemingly <unk> 
He sank back on his thin <unk> like a weary <unk> Then he began 
to crawl again. Watson watched the creeping figure. He felt a spectator <unk> Would the man make it or not? If only there was a <unk> for him to crawl <unk> If he failed to reach the <unk> 
in five minutes, say, then the <unk> would pull away and leave him <unk> 
in the <unk> <unk> three minutes to make it <unk> Still the guards 
did not <unk> but stood <unk> <unk> from the <unk> man. 
The figure <unk> and Watson <unk> The man began to creep in 
the wrong direction, <unk> by a slight rise in the <unk> He turned 
slowly and began to crawl back up the bank toward the <unk> Watson <unk> for him, his boots <unk> the soft earth.   The guards 
came to life with astonishing <unk> They spun and flung their rifles

what would you have made of a bomb shelter <unk> with four <unk> <unk>

long <unk> and red <unk> As I say, I wouldn't want to 
begin a day like this, but I often wonder what the dead would have done. 
But the shelter is as much a part of my landscape as the <unk> and <unk> trees that grow on the <unk> I can see it from this <unk> where I <unk> It was built by the <unk> and stands on 
the acre of ground that <unk> our property. It <unk> under a veil of <unk> new grass, like some embarrassing fact of <unk> and I 
think Mrs& Pastern set out the <unk> to <unk> its meaning. It 
would have been like her. She was a pale woman. <unk> on her <unk> 
sitting in her <unk> sitting anywhere, she ground an <unk> of <unk> <unk> her a cup of tea and she would say, "Why, these cups 
look just like a set I gave to the <unk> Army last year". <unk> her the new swimming pool and she would say, <unk> her <unk> 
"I suppose this must be where you breed your gigantic <unk> <unk> her a chair and she would say, "Why, it's a nice imitation 
of those Queen Anne chairs I inherited from <unk> <unk> 
These <unk> were more touching than they were anything else, 
and seemed to imply that the nights were long, her children <unk> 
and her marriage <unk> <unk> Twenty years ago, she would 
have been known as a golf widow, and the sum of her manner was perhaps 
one of <unk> She usually wore <unk> and a stranger watching 
her board a train might have guessed that Mr& Pastern was dead, 
but Mr& Pastern was far from dead. He was marching up and down 
the <unk> room of the <unk> <unk> Golf Club shouting, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Let's throw a little nuclear hardware at them 
and show them who's <unk> He was <unk> of the club's <unk> 
light <unk> and at one time or another declared war on Russia, <unk> <unk> and China.   It all began 
on an autumn <unk> and who, after all these centuries, can describe 
the <unk> of an autumn day? One might <unk> never to have 
seen one before, or, to more purpose, that there would never be another 
like it. The clear and searching sweep of sun on the <unk> was like 
a climax of the year's <unk> <unk> were burning somewhere and 
the smoke <unk> for all its <unk> <unk> of <unk> The <unk> blue air was stretched over the <unk> like the skin of a <unk> <unk> her house one late afternoon, Mrs& Pastern stopped to <unk> the October light. It was the day to <unk> for infectious <unk> Mrs& Pastern had been given sixteen names, a bundle of <unk> and a printed book of <unk> It was her work to go among

Mrs& Ten <unk> did mental health. Mrs& <unk> worked for

Mrs& <unk> was <unk> and way in the distance could be seen the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> house, a roof that <unk> <unk> Pastern undertook the work of going from house to house 
with the <unk> resignation of an honest and traditional <unk> 
It was her <unk> it was her life. Her mother had done it before 
her, and even her old <unk> who had collected money for <unk> 
and unwed <unk> Mrs& Pastern had telephoned most of her neighbors 
in <unk> and most of them were ready for her. She experienced 
none of the <unk> of some poor stranger selling <unk> Here 
and there she stayed to visit and drink a glass of <unk> The contributions 
were ahead of what she had got the previous year, and while 
the money, of course, was not <unk> it excited her to stuff her <unk> 
with big <unk> She stopped at the <unk> after <unk> and had 
a <unk> She stayed too late, and when she left, it was 
dark and time to go home and cook supper for her husband. "I got a 
hundred and sixty dollars for the <unk> <unk> she said <unk> 
when he walked in. "I did everybody on my list but the <unk> 
and the <unk> I want to get my <unk> in tomorrow <unk> would 
you mind doing them while I cook the <unk>   "But I 
don't know the <unk> Charlie Pastern said.   "Nobody <unk> but they gave me ten last year".   He was tired, he 
had his business <unk> and the sight of his wife arranging pork <unk> 
in the <unk> only seemed like an extension of a <unk> day. He 
was happy enough to take the convertible and race up the hill to the <unk> thinking that they might give him a drink. But the <unk> 
were <unk> their maid gave him an envelope with a check in it and <unk> the door. Turning in at the <unk> <unk> he tried 
to remember if he had ever met them. The name encouraged him, because 
he always felt that he could <unk> the <unk> There was a glass <unk> in the front door, and through this he could see into a hallway 
where a <unk> woman with red hair was arranging flowers.   <unk> <unk> he shouted <unk>   She took a good look 
at herself in the mirror before she turned and, walking with very 
small steps, started toward the door. "Oh, please come <unk> she said. 
The <unk> voice was nearly a <unk> She was not a girl, he 
could see. Her hair was <unk> and her bloom was <unk> and she must 
have been crowding <unk> but she seemed to be one of those women who <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> of a pretty child of <unk> "Your wife 
just <unk> she said, separating one word from another, exactly 
like a child. "And I am not sure that I have any <unk> any <unk> 
that is- but if you will wait just a minute I will write you 
out a check if I can find my <unk> <unk> you step into the 
living room, where it's <unk>   A fire had just been <unk> 
he saw, and things had been set out for <unk> and, like any <unk> his response to these <unk> was <unk> Where was <unk> <unk> he <unk> <unk> home on a late <unk> <unk> his clothes <unk> Taking a <unk> At the end of the 
room there was a desk <unk> with <unk> and she began to <unk> these, 
making <unk> and and <unk> of <unk> <unk> "I am terribly <unk> to keep you <unk> she said, "but won't you make <unk> a little drink while you <unk> <unk> on the <unk> train does Mr& <unk> come out <unk> <unk> is <unk> she said. Her voice <unk> <unk> <unk> has been away for six weeks **h".   "I'll

She described herself and her circumstances <unk> Mr& <unk> manufactured plastic tongue <unk> He <unk> 
all over the world. She didn't like to <unk> <unk> made her feel <unk> and in <unk> where she had gone that summer, she had been given 
raw fish for breakfast and so she had come straight home. She and 
her husband had formerly lived in New York, where she had many friends, 
but Mr& <unk> thought the country would be <unk> in case 
of war. She would rather live in danger than die of <unk> and <unk> 
She had no children; she had made no friends. "I've seen 
you, though, before", she said with enormous <unk> <unk> his <unk> "I've seen you walking your dogs on Sunday and driving by 
in the convertible **h".   The thought of this lonely woman sitting 
at her window touched him, although he was even more touched by 
her <unk> <unk> <unk> he knew, is not a vital part of the 
body and has no <unk> functions. It serves merely as an excess <unk> for the rest of the <unk> And knowing its humble place in 
the scale of things, why did he, at this time of life, seem almost ready 
to sell his soul for <unk> The remarks she made about the <unk> 
of a lonely woman seemed so broad at first that he didn't 
know what to make of them, but after the sixth drink he put his arm around 
her and suggested that they go upstairs and look for her <unk> 
there.   "I've never done this before", she said later, 
when he was arranging himself to leave. Her voice shook with feeling, 
and he thought it <unk> He didn't doubt her <unk> although 
he had heard the words a hundred times. "I've never done this <unk> they always said, shaking their dresses down over their white <unk> "I've never done this before", they always said, 
waiting for the elevator in the hotel <unk> "I've never done 
this before", they always said, pouring another <unk> "I've 
never done this before", they always said, putting on their <unk> 
On ships at sea, on railroad <unk> in summer hotels with mountain <unk> 
they always said, "I've never done this <unk> <unk> 
have you <unk> Mrs& Pastern asked <unk> when he came 
in. "It's after <unk>   "I had a drink with the <unk> told me he was in <unk>   "He 
came home <unk>   Charlie ate some supper in the <unk> and went into the ~TV room to hear the news. <unk> <unk> 
he shouted. <unk> a little nuclear hardware at <unk> Show 
them who's <unk> But in bed he had trouble <unk> He thought 
first of his son and daughter, away at college. He loved them. 
It was the only meaning of the word that he had ever known. Then he 
played nine imaginary holes of <unk> choosing his <unk> his <unk> 
his <unk> his <unk> and his weather in detail, but the green of 
the links seemed faded in the light of his business <unk> His money 
was tied up in a Nassau hotel, an Ohio pottery works, and a detergent 
for <unk> and luck had been running against him. His <unk> <unk> him up out of bed, and he lighted a cigarette and went 
to the window. In the <unk> he could see the trees stripped of their <unk> During the summer he had tried to repair some of his losses 
at the track, and the bare trees reminded him that his <unk> <unk> would still be <unk> like leaves, in the <unk> near <unk> 
and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> one hundred to win on 
Three in the <unk> fifty to win on Six in the third, one hundred 
to win on Two in the <unk> Children walking home from school would <unk> through what seemed to be his <unk> Then, getting back into <unk> he thought <unk> of Mrs& <unk> planning where they 
would next meet and what they would do. There are, he thought, so few 
true means of <unk> in this life that why should he <unk> the <unk> even when the medicine seemed, as it did, a little <unk> 
It was not as though she noted clearly that her <unk> had not been 
to see her for ten years, not since their last journey <unk> to witness 
their Uncle <unk> being lowered into the rocky <unk> that aside 
from due <unk> of certain major events in their lives <unk> marriages, 
two <unk> one <unk> Christmas and Easter cards of the 
traditional sort had been the only thin link she had with them through 
the <unk> years. Her thoughts were not <unk> But there was 
a look about her mouth as though she were <unk> <unk>   She <unk> the chair arms and brought her thin body <unk> like a bird <unk> for flight. She turned and walked stiffly into the parlor to the <unk> <unk> <unk> and cracked now from fifty years in 
an atmosphere of sea <unk> There she extracted two limp <unk> sheets 
and wrote off the letters, one to <unk> one to <unk>   Once 
her trembling hand, with the pen grasped tight in it, was pressed against 
the paper the words came <unk> <unk> as <unk> as 
they would dropping from her own lips. And the stiffly <unk> look of 
them, she saw <unk> lacked the <unk> of age which, <unk> the efforts 
of her amazing will, ran through her spoken words like a thin ragged <unk> "Please come down as soon as you conveniently <unk> 
the upright letters stalked from the <unk> <unk> "I have an 
important matter to discuss with you". To <unk> "I am afraid 
there is not much to <unk> small children here. I should be obliged 
if you could make other arrangements for your <unk> You may stay 
as long as you wish, of course, but if arranging for the care of the 
girls must take time into <unk> I think a day or two should be enough 
to finish our business in". To <unk> "Please give my <unk> 
to <unk>   She signed the letters quickly, stamped them, and 
placed them on the hall table for <unk> to mail in town. Then she 
went back to the <unk> chair and <unk> adjusted her eyes to the <unk> on the water.   "My <unk> will be coming <unk> she 
said that evening as <unk> brought her dinner into the dining room, 
the whole meal on a vast <unk> <unk> She looked at the girl <unk> from eyes which had <unk> with the years; from the 
early evening lights of them which had first startled <unk> to look 
at 
her in an <unk> way, they had faded to a <unk> of color which <unk> possibly from her constant looking at the water, something of 
the light of the sea in them.   <unk> placed the tray on the 
table and with a <unk> of dark <unk> drew off the <unk> She smiled, 
and the teeth <unk> in her beautifully <unk> <unk> face. "That 
will be so nice for you, Mrs& <unk> she said. Her voice was <unk> and full and her teeth flashed again in <unk> <unk> before 
the warm <unk> lips met and her mouth settled in <unk> <unk> said the old lady, and brought her eyes down to the <unk> 
"You remember them, I <unk> She <unk> <unk> at the <unk> before <unk> <unk> I hope <unk> bought them <unk> stepped back, her eyes <unk> the tray for <unk> 
Then she looked at the old woman again, her eyes <unk>   "Yes", 
she said, "I remember that they came here every summer. 
I used to play with the older one <unk> when he'd let me. <unk> 
The name fell with <unk> <unk> <unk> from her lips. 
For an instant the old <unk> felt something <unk> flash through 
her smile. She would have said triumph. Then <unk> turned and 
with an easy grace walked toward the kitchen.   Jessica Packard <unk> her head and followed the <unk> figure, her eyes resting 
nearly closed on the <unk> rise and fall of the rounded <unk> 
For a moment she held her face to the empty <unk> then she <unk> 
and groped for her <unk>   There's no greater <unk> 
in the universe, she reflected <unk> <unk> tender green <unk> 
on the silver <unk> than the <unk> away of a family. <unk> <unk> <unk> these are the laws of living things, with 
the penalty for not <unk> them the ultimate in <unk> <unk> 
When the fate of the individual is visited on the group, then (the 
warm sweet butter <unk> from her raised trembling fork and she pushed 
her head forward <unk> <unk> then the true bitterness of <unk> could be <unk> And indeed the young garden <unk> were <unk> 
in her mouth.   She was the last living of the older generation. 
What had once been a widespread family- at one time, she knew, 
there were enough <unk> to <unk> an entire <unk> had now <unk> down to the two boys, Abel and <unk> She swung her eyes up 
to the blue of the window, her <unk> gently <unk> the bitter <unk> 
What hope lay in the <unk> she asked the <unk> light out there, 
with one married to a <unk> woman and the other <unk> having <unk> two girl children, with none to bear on the Packard <unk> <unk> It seemed to her, as it seemed each night, that the gloom <unk> itself in and became <unk> at the <unk> empty chairs, 
giving her the frequent illusion that she <unk> with <unk> Here, too, 
she talked low, <unk> her head at one or another of the places, 
most often at <unk> <unk> which faced her across the long table. 
Or it might have been the absent <unk> she <unk> consciously 
playing with the notion that this was one of the <unk> of their early 
years.   She thought again of her children, those two who had 
died young, before the later science which might have saved them could <unk> even a label to their separate <unk> The girl, her <unk> she barely <unk> It could have been <unk> <unk> for 
it had not survived the <unk> But the boy **h the boy had been <unk> yesterday. Each successive movement in his growing was recorded 
on the <unk> film inside her. He ran on his <unk> sticks of <unk> <unk> now and again into the sudden startled attitudes which the <unk> had caught and held on the <unk> <unk> all carefully placed 
and glued and <unk> resting in the fat <unk> <unk> in the bottom <unk> of the <unk> In the cruel <unk> of her memory the 
boy remained <unk> quick with the delight of laughter, and the pain 
with which she recalled that short destroyed childhood was still <unk> 
to her. It was one with the <unk> rocks and the alien water 
on those days when she hated the sea. ##

The brothers drove 
down together in <unk> small red sports car, Mark at the wheel. They <unk> <unk> Abel sat and regarded the farm country which, spreading 
out from both sides of the road, rolled <unk> up to where the <unk> white houses and long <unk> and <unk> <unk> into the <unk> fields. 
He saw the land with a <unk> eyes, all the old <unk> <unk> And it presented itself to him as it would to any stranger, <unk> complete in itself. There was stability there, too- a 
color which his life had had once. That is what childhood is, he told <unk> <unk> settled **h lost. In the stiff neutral lines of the 
telephone <unk> he saw the <unk> pen strokes of Aunt <unk> <unk> What bad grace, what incredible <unk> he and Mark 
had <unk> The <unk> <unk> preceding their <unk> funeral might 
never have been. They had closed over, <unk> with the <unk> 
of old <unk> <unk> The small car flew on <unk> The old <unk> <unk> <unk> in the house above the crashing waters took 
on an ominous reality. Abel moved and adjusted his long <unk> suppose it has to do with the <unk> Mark had said over 
the telephone when they had discussed their <unk> of the letters. 
Not until the words had been spoken did Abel suddenly see the old house 
and the insistent sea, and feel his <unk> <unk> out in one <unk> moment of <unk> He and Mark were the last of the family, 
and there lay the Cape Ann property which had seemed to have no <unk> stretching from horizon to <unk> in those golden days of <unk> Abel turned his head to look at his brother. Mark held 
the wheel <unk> but his fingers <unk> around it in a <unk> 
way and the deliberate set of his body spoke plainly of the figure he'd 
make in the years to come. His <unk> hair was already beginning 
to thin and <unk> at the sides, and Abel looked quickly away. Mark 
easily looked years older than himself, settled, his world comfortably <unk>   The vacation traffic was becoming heavier as they 
approached the sea. "She didn't mention bringing <unk> Mark 
said, <unk> the car into the next <unk> "She's probably 
getting <unk> <unk> I <unk> and we figured <unk> better not. <unk> never <unk> you know. But Myra wouldn't <unk> without 
an express <unk> I feel kind of bad about it". He gave Abel 
a quick glance and moved closer to the wheel, <unk> it to him, and <unk> caught this <unk> of <unk> to guilt.   "I imagine 
the old girl hasn't missed us much", Mark added, his eyes on the <unk> Abel ignored the <unk> bid for <unk> He smiled. 
It was barely possible that his brother was right.   He could 
tell they were approaching the sea. The air took on a special strength 
now that they'd left the <unk> warmth of the <unk> <unk> 
There was the smell of the <unk> like a <unk> memory, composed 
of equal parts salt water, <unk> <unk> and northern air. He turned 
from the flying trees to look ahead and saw with an inward boy's eye 
again the great <unk> house which, built on one of the many acres 
of <unk> land bordering the west <unk> had been <unk> <unk> 
to his <unk> as the last century ended.   <unk> <unk> must have been keeping silent pace beside his own, climbing 
the same <unk> in dirty white <unk> <unk> out on top of the <unk> and coming upon the sudden <unk> water at the same <unk> <unk> the <unk> Mark asked, and Abel lifted his 
eyes from the double lines in the middle of the road, the twin white <unk> which the car swallowed rapidly as it <unk> the crest of 
the hill and came down.   "The <unk> Abel said. There 
was the day Uncle <unk> had, in an unexpected <unk> gesture, <unk> over the pretty <unk> to Abel for <unk> on condition that 
he never fail to let his brother accompany him whenever the younger boy <unk> The two of them had developed into a remarkable sailing team 
**h all of this happening in a time of their lives when their youth 
and their <unk> knitted them together as no other time or circumstance <unk> They seemed then to have had a single mind and body, a <unk> which had been accepted with the fact of their youth, <unk> 
He saw the <unk> as she <unk> her slender <unk> up and gently <unk> its point describing constant <unk> circles against a <unk> <unk> Both of them had known the feeling of the small life in her <unk> <unk> for the two of them to run up her <unk> The <unk> 
had been long at the bottom of the <unk>   They came unexpectedly 
upon the sea. <unk> it without preparation as they did, robbed 
of <unk> a common disappointment seized them. They were <unk> the hill in the night when the headlights abruptly <unk> solid <unk> became two parallel luminous tubes which broadened out into 
a faint mist of light and ended. Mark stopped the car and switched 
off the lights and they sat looking at the water, which, there being 
no moon out, at first could be distinguished from the sky only by an <unk> of stars. 
His eyes were old and they never saw well, but heated with whisky they'd <unk> at my noise, growing red and raising up his <unk> I decided 
I hated the Pedersen kid too, dying in our kitchen while I was away 
where I couldn't watch, dying just to entertain Hans and making 
me go up snapping steps and down a <unk> hall, Pa <unk> under the <unk> at the end like <unk> covered with snow, <unk> and <unk> <unk> he'd not care about the Pedersen <unk> He'd not care about getting <unk> so he could give up some of his whisky to a <unk> of a kid 
and maybe lose one of his hiding places in the <unk> That would make 
him mad enough if he was <unk> I didn't hurry though it was cold 
and the Pedersen kid was in the kitchen.   He was all <unk> 
up like I thought he'd be. I pushed at his shoulder, calling 
his <unk> I think his name stopped the <unk> but he didn't move except 
to roll a little when I shoved him. The covers slid down his <unk> <unk> so I saw his head, <unk> like a <unk> gone to <unk> but 
his face was turned to the <unk> there was the pale shadow of his nose 
on the <unk> and I thought, <unk> you don't look much like 
a <unk> <unk> now. I couldn't be sure he was still asleep. He 
was a <unk> <unk> I shook him a little harder and made some <unk> <unk> I said.   I was leaning too far over. 
I knew better. He always slept close to the wall so you had to lean 
to reach him. <unk> he was <unk> It put you off. I knew better but 
I was thinking of the Pedersen kid <unk> in all that <unk> 
When his arm came up I <unk> away but it caught me on the side of 
the neck, <unk> my eyes, and I backed off to <unk> Pa was on his <unk> looking at me, his eyes <unk> the hand that had hit me a fist 
in the <unk>   "Get the hell out of here".   I didn't 
say anything, trying to get my throat clear, but I watched him. 
He was like a mean horse to come at from the rear. It was better, though, 
he'd hit me. He was bitter when he missed.   "Get the <unk> out of here".   <unk> Hans sent me. He told me to wake <unk>   "A fat hell on Big <unk> Get out of <unk> found the Pedersen kid by the <unk>   "Get the <unk> out".   Pa pulled at the <unk> He was <unk> his <unk> kid's <unk> good. Hans is rubbing him with snow. <unk> got him in the <unk>   <unk> <unk> <unk> It's the Pedersen <unk> The <unk>   <unk> 
to <unk> from the <unk>   "Not <unk> <unk> He was just <unk> there. Hans found him <unk> That's where he was when Hans 
found him".   Pa laughed.   "I ain't <unk> nothing in 
the <unk>   "You don't understand, <unk> The Pedersen <unk> The <unk>   "I god damn well <unk>   Pa 
had his head up, <unk> his teeth <unk> at the place where he'd <unk> a <unk> once.   "I god damn well understand. You 
know I don't want to see <unk> That <unk> Why should I? What 
did he come for, <unk> God <unk> <unk> And don't come back. <unk> out something. You're a <unk> Both you and <unk> <unk> 
That <unk> Don't come back. <unk> <unk>   He was shouting 
and breathing hard and closing his fist on the <unk> He had long 
black hairs on his <unk> They curled around the <unk> of his <unk> Hans made me come. Big Hans <unk>   "A <unk> hell on Big <unk> He's an even bigger fool than you are. <unk> <unk> I taught him, <unk> and I'll teach you. <unk> You 
want me to drop my <unk>   He was about to get up so I got 
out, <unk> the door. He was beginning to see he was too mad to sleep. 
Then he threw things. Once he went after Hans and dumped his pot 
over the <unk> <unk> been <unk> in that <unk> Hans got an <unk> He didn't even bother to wipe himself off and he <unk> part 
of <unk> door down before he stopped. He might not have gone that 
far if Pa hadn't been locked in laughing fit to shake the house. 
That pot put Pa in an awful good humor whenever he thought of it. I 
always felt the memory was present in both of them, stirring in their <unk> like a laugh or a <unk> as eager as an animal to be out. I 
heard Pa <unk> all the way <unk>   Hans had laid <unk> <unk> over the kid's chest and stomach. He was rubbing snow on 
the kid's legs and feet. Water from the snow and water from the towels 
had run off the kid to the table where the dough was, and the dough 
was turning <unk> sticking to the kid's back and <unk>   <unk> 
he going to wake <unk>   "What about your <unk> was awake when I <unk>   <unk> he <unk> <unk> you get the <unk>   "He said a fat hell on Big <unk>   "Don't be <unk> Did you ask him about the <unk>   <unk>   "He said 
a fat hell on Big <unk>   "Don't be <unk> What's 
he going to do"?   "Go back to sleep most <unk> best get that <unk>   "You go. Take the <unk> <unk> scared to hell of <unk>   <unk> to me, <unk> 
I've had enough to your <unk> This kid's <unk> bad. If I don't 
get some whisky down him he might die. You want the kid to <unk> 
Do you? Well, get your <unk> and get that <unk>   <unk> 
don't care about the <unk>   <unk>   <unk> 
he <unk> He don't care at all, and I don't care to get my head <unk> neither. He don't care, and I don't care to have his <unk> <unk> on me. He don't care about <unk> All he cares about is 
his whisky and that dry crack in his face. Get <unk> that's 
what he <unk> He don't care about nothing else at all. <unk> 
Not <unk> kid neither. That <unk> Not the kid <unk> get the <unk> Ma said.   I'd wound Big <unk> up tight. I was ready to jump but when Ma said she'd get the <unk> it surprised him like it surprised me, and he ran down. Ma 
never went near the old man when he was sleeping it off. Not any more. 
Not for years. The first thing every morning when she washed her face 
she could see the scar on her chin where he'd cut her with a <unk> <unk> and maybe she saw him <unk> it again, the dirty <unk> <unk> 
out as it <unk> It should have been nearly as easy for her to remember 
that as it was for Big Hans to remember going after the <unk> while 
he was still <unk> with <unk> yellow sick <unk>   "No 
you <unk> Big Hans said.   "Yes, <unk> if they're <unk> <unk> said.   Hans shook his head but neither of us tried 
to stop her. If we had, then one of us would have had to go instead. <unk> rubbed the kid with more snow **h rubbed **h <unk>   "I'll 
get more <unk> I said. I took the <unk> and <unk> and went 
out on the porch. I don't know where Ma went. I thought she'd 
gone upstairs and expected to hear she had. She had surprised Hans 
like she had surprised me when she said she'd go, and then she surprised 
him again when she came back so quick like she must have, because 
when I 
came in with the snow she was there with a bottle with three 
white feathers on its label and Hans was holding it <unk> by the <unk> he was being <unk> and <unk> <unk> about in the <unk> and holding the bottle like a snake at the length of his arm. 
He was awful angry because he'd thought Ma was going to do something <unk> something heroic even, especially for her **h I know him **h 
I know him **h we felt the same sometimes **h while Ma wasn't thinking 
about 
that at all, not anything like that. There was no way of getting <unk> It wasn't like getting <unk> at the fair. They were always 
trying so you got to expect it. Now Hans had given Ma something of <unk> we both had when we thought she was going straight to <unk> 
something <unk> but since she didn't know we'd given it to her, 
there was no easy way of getting it back.   Hans cut the foil 
off finally and <unk> the <unk> He was put out too because there 
was only one way of understanding what she'd done. Ma had found one 
of <unk> hiding places. She'd found one and she hadn't said a 
word while Big Hans and I had hunted and hunted as we always did all <unk> every winter since the spring that Hans had come and I had 
looked in the <unk> and found the first one. Pa had a <unk> for <unk> 
He knew we were looking and he enjoyed it. But now <unk> She'd 
found it by luck most likely but she hadn't said anything and we didn't 
know how long ago <unk> been or how many other ones she'd found, 
saying nothing. Pa was sure to find out. Sometimes he didn't 
seem to because he <unk> them so well he couldn't find them himself or 
because he looked and didn't find anything and figured he hadn't <unk> one after all or had drunk it up. But he'd find out about this 
one because we were using it. A fool could see what was going on. If 
he found out Ma found it- <unk> be bad. He took pride in his <unk> It was all the pride he had. I guess <unk> Hans and me took <unk> But he didn't figure Ma for much. He didn't figure her 
at all, and if he found out 
**h a woman **h <unk> be bad.   Hans <unk> some in a <unk>   "You going to put more towels on <unk>   "Why not? That's what he needs, 
something warm to his skin, don't <unk>   "Not where <unk> <unk> good. <unk> bad for <unk> That's why I only 
put towels on his chest and <unk> He's got to thaw <unk> You ought 
to know that".   <unk> on the towels had run.   Ma <unk> 
her toe in the kid's clothes.   "What are we going to do 
with <unk>   Big Hans began pouring whisky in the kid's <unk> but his mouth filled without any getting down his throat and in 
a second it was dripping from his <unk>   <unk> help me <unk> 
him up. I got hold his mouth <unk>   I didn't want to touch 
him and I hoped Ma would do it but she kept looking at the kid's <unk> piled on the floor and the pool of water by them and didn't 
make any move to.   "Come on, <unk>   "All <unk> don't <unk> **h <unk>   <unk> 
I'm <unk>   I took him by the shoulders. His head flopped 
back. His mouth fell open. The skin on his neck was tight. He 
was cold all right.   <unk> his head up. He'll <unk> mouth is <unk>   "His <unk> <unk> He'll <unk>   "He'll choke <unk>   <unk> his 
head up".   "I <unk>   "Don't hold him like 
that. Put your arms around him".   <unk> <unk> 
He was cold all right. I put my arm carefully around him. Hans had 
his fingers in the kid's mouth.   "Now he'll choke for <unk> up. Just hold him like I told you".   He 
was cold all right, and <unk> I had my arm behind his back. 
He was in his <unk> at this time, long past the establishment of 
his name and the wish to be <unk> yet once again, and it was almost 
a decade since he had <unk> off <unk> There was never a doubt 
any more how his structures would be <unk> it was always the same <unk> success now. He could no longer build anything, whether 
a private residence in his Pennsylvania county or a church in <unk> 
without it being obvious that he had done it, and while here and there 
he was taken to task for again developing the same <unk> <unk> 
they were such <unk> and sometimes even <unk> buildings that the 
public felt assured by its sense of recognition after a time, a quality 
of authentic <unk> about them, which, once established by an <unk> as his private vision, is no longer <unk> as to its other <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> a <unk> of a genuine <unk> in foreign eyes, an original designer whose <unk> <unk> with steel and concrete was made even more <unk> sincere 
by his <unk> He had lived for almost thirty years in this 
same stone <unk> with the same wife, a remarkably childish thing 
in itself; he rose at <unk> six every morning, made himself some 
French coffee, had his corn <unk> and more coffee, smoked four cigarettes 
while reading last Sunday's <unk> <unk> and yesterday's <unk> <unk> then put on his <unk> farmer's <unk> and walked under a <unk> <unk> to his <unk> This was an enormously 
long building whose walls were made of <unk> some of them brought 
home from every continent during his six years as an oil <unk> 
The <unk> of his other careers was piled <unk> a pile of <unk> <unk> for <unk> from his time as a <unk> and a microscope lying 
on its side on the window <unk> vertical steel columns wired for support 
to the open ceiling beams with <unk> steel <unk> <unk> 
out into the air, masonry <unk> on the floor from the time he 
was <unk> his disastrous <unk> whose smoke would pass through 
a whole house, visible all the way up through wire <unk> on each 
floor. His <unk> desk, <unk> board and a high stool formed the only 
clean island in the <unk> <unk> else his ideas lay or hung in <unk> <unk> his models, <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> 
from his painting days, and <unk> a <unk> of <unk> books 
that looked as though their <unk> had been <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> he had once used as the basis of the design for 
the <unk> <unk> Company plant hung on a rope in one corner, and over 
his desk, next to several old and dusty <unk> was a clean pair of <unk> <unk> which he occasionally used up and down in front of his house. 
He worked <unk> with his left hand in his pocket as though he 
were merely stopping for a moment, <unk> with the surprised stare 
of one who was watching another <unk> hand. Sometimes he would <unk> softly to some <unk> <unk> beside him, sometimes he would 
look stern and <unk> as his pencil did what he <unk> It 
all <unk> if one could have <unk> in at him through one of his <unk> 
as though this <unk> man with the muscular arms and <unk> <unk> was merely the <unk> trying his hand at the <unk> 
work. This air of <unk> carried over to his apparent attitude 
toward his things, and people often <unk> it for <unk> in him 
or a surrender to <unk> <unk> But he was not bored at <unk> 
he had found his style quite early in his career and he thought it quite <unk> that the world admired it, and he could not imagine why he 
should alter it. There are, after all, fortunate souls who hear everything, 
but only know how to listen to what is good for them, and <unk> 
was, as things go, a fortunate man.   He left his home the 
day after New Year's wearing a <unk> and <unk> <unk> and 
without a <unk> He would wear this same costume in Florida, despite his 
wife <unk> <unk> over the past five days that he must take 
some cool clothes with him. But he was too busy to hear what she was <unk> So they <unk> when she was in an impatient humor. When he 
was bent over behind the wheel of the station wagon, feeling in his <unk> <unk> for the <unk> key which he had dropped a moment before, 
she came out of the house with an enormous <unk> <unk> over her 
head, which she had bought in that country during one of their trips abroad, 
and handed him a clean <unk> through the window. <unk> 
the key under his <unk> he started the <unk> and while it warmed up 
he turned to her standing there in the dripping fog, and said, <unk> 
the <unk>   He saw the surprise in her face, and <unk> as though it were the <unk> expression he had ever seen. 
He kept on laughing until she started laughing with him. He had a deep 
voice which was full of good food she had <unk> and good <unk> 
an explosive laugh which always carried everything before it. He would <unk> himself into his seat to <unk> Whenever he laughed it was 
all he was doing. And she was made to fall in love with him again there 
in the <unk> dirt driveway standing in the cold fog, mad as she was 
at his going away when he really didn't have to, mad at their both 
having got older in a life that seemed to have taken no more than a 
week to go by. She was <unk> at this time, a <unk> woman of <unk> 
with an <unk> narrow face which had the distinction of a <unk> 
or some architecture that had been designed long ago for a stubborn 
sort of <unk> Her eyebrows were definite and heavy and formed two 
lines moving upward toward a high forehead and a great head of brown hair 
that fell to her shoulders. There was an air of <unk> in her <unk> eyes, the <unk> look that ultimately comes to some women 
who are born at the end of an <unk> line long since <unk> from <unk> and which, <unk> has kept its estate <unk> She was <unk> <unk> and when she had <unk> would blow her nose in the 
same <unk> all day and keep it, soaking <unk> <unk> from her <unk> and when she <unk> she would eat dinner with dirt on her <unk> 
But just when she seemed to have sunk into some <unk> of <unk> 
she would disappear and come down <unk> <unk> and taking <unk> of air, and even with her broken nails her hands would come to 
rest on a table or a leaf with a <unk> <unk> a grace of history, 
so to speak, and for an instant one saw how <unk> proud she 
was and <unk> on certain questions of personal value. She even spoke <unk> when she was clean, and she was clean now for his departure 
and her voice clear and rather <unk>   "Now drive <unk> 
for God's <unk> she called, trying to attain a half humorous <unk> at his <unk> But he did not <unk> and was already <unk> the car down to the road, saying <unk> to the <unk> of a tree as he passed it, the same <unk> which had <unk> the 
car of many a guest in the past thirty years and which he refused to 
have removed. She stood clutching her <unk> around her shoulders until 
he had swung the car onto the road. Then, when he had it pointed 
down the hill, he stopped to gaze at her through the window. She had <unk> to turn back toward the house, but his look caught her and she stood <unk> waiting there for what his expression indicated would be 
a 
serious word of <unk> He looked at her out of himself, she thought, 
as he did only for an instant at a time, the look which always surprised 
her even now when his <unk> hair was <unk> a little and 
his breath came hard through his <unk> <unk> the look of the <unk> youth she had suddenly found herself staring at in the <unk> <unk> on a Thursday once. Now she kept herself <unk> ready 
to laugh again and sure enough he pointed at her with his index finger 
and said <unk> once more and roared off into the fog, his foot <unk> surprising him with the <unk> with which it pressed 
the <unk> just as his hand did when he worked. She walked back 
to the house and <unk> feeling herself <unk> sensing some kind 
of opportunity in the empty building. There is a death in all <unk> 
she knew, and promptly put it out of her mind.   She enjoyed 
great parties when she would sit up talking and dancing and drinking 
all night, but it always seemed to her that being alone, especially 
alone in her house, was the <unk> part of life. Now she could let out 
the three <unk> without fear they would be stepped on or that <unk> 
would let them out one of the <unk> she could dust the plants, 
then break off suddenly and pick up an old novel and read from the 
middle <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> and finally, the best part of 
all, simply sit at the <unk> table in the kitchen with a bottle of wine 
and the newspapers, reading the ads as well as the news, <unk> 
nothing on her mind but letting her soul <unk> itself above all <unk> 
and desire. She did this now, comfortably aware of the mist running 
down the windows, of the silence outside, of the dark afternoon 
it was getting to be. She fell asleep leaning on her hand, hearing the 
house <unk> as though it were a living a private life of its own 
these two hundred years, hearing the birds rustling in their <unk> and 
the occasional <unk> of wings as one of them landed on the table and 
walked across the newspaper to <unk> in the <unk> of her arm. Every 
few minutes she would awaken for a moment to review things: <unk> <unk> was on his way south, and the two boys were away in school, and 
nothing was burning on the <unk> and <unk> was coming for dinner 
and bringing three guests of hers. Then she fell asleep again as <unk> 
as a person with fever, and when she awoke it was dark outside 
and the clarity was back in her eyes. She stood up, <unk> her hair <unk> <unk> her clothes, feeling a <unk> for the <unk> <unk> outside, and, above everything else, for the absence of 
the need to answer, to <unk> to be aware even of <unk> coming in 
or going out, and yet, now that she was beginning to <unk> she <unk> 
a future without him, a future alone like this, and the pain made her 
head <unk> and in a moment she found it hard to wait for <unk> 
to come with her guests. She went into the living room and turned on 
three <unk> then back into the kitchen where she turned on the ceiling 
light and the switch that lit the <unk> on the barn, <unk> 
the <unk> She knew she was feeling afraid and <unk> laughed at <unk> They were both so young, after all, so <unk> for any final <unk> How could it have been thirty years <unk> she <unk> 
But yes, nineteen plus thirty was <unk> and she was <unk> 
and she had been married at <unk> She stood still over the leg 
of <unk> rubbing <unk> into it, quite suddenly conscious of a <unk> 
in her stomach and a feeling of <unk> a sensation of violence that started 
her <unk> they all said, "No, your time will come. <unk> being a <unk> while you <unk>   There was no room for company in the <unk> <unk> House <unk> the <unk> boys always took their <unk> 
till they could get a house and a farm of their <unk> So when the <unk> House filled up and ran over, the <unk> found <unk> for 
everyone in their own homes. And there was still not anything that Linda <unk> could do.   So Linda Kay gave up asking, and accepted 
her <unk> Without saying so, she was really <unk> for to <unk> the dying was something she had never <unk> and certainly 
had not imagined when she thought of the duties she would have as Bobby <unk> wife. She had made curtains for all the windows of her 
little house, and she had kept it <unk> and <unk> <unk> as it was, 
and cooked good meals for Bobby <unk> She had done all the things she 
had promised herself she would do, but she had not thought of this. 
People died, she would have said, in <unk> or in cars on the highway 
at night.   Bobby Joe was gone all day now, not coming in 
for dinner and sometimes not for <unk> When they first married he 
had been working in the fields all day, and she would get in the car and 
drive to wherever he was working, to take him a fresh hot <unk> Now 
there was no work in the fields, nor would there be till it <unk> 
and she did not know where he went. Not that she <unk> or had any 
cause to. Four or five of the cousins from East Texas were about 
his age, so naturally they ran around together. There was no reason 
for her to ask what they did.   Thus a new pattern of days began 
to <unk> for <unk> <unk> did not die. She lay still on the <unk> her head hardly <unk> the <unk> sometimes she opened her eyes 
and looked around, and sometimes she took a little milk or <unk> They 
stopped expecting her to die the next minute, but only in the next 
day or two. Those who had driven hundreds of miles for the <unk> would 
not go home, for she might die any time; but they might as well <unk> their <unk> for she might linger on.   So the pattern 
was established. When Linda Kay had put up her breakfast dishes 
and <unk> her <unk> <unk> she would go to the Big House. There 
was not anything she could do there, but that was where everyone was, 
or would be. Bobby Joe and the boys would come by, say <unk> <unk> 
and sit on the porch a while. The older men would be there 
at noon, and maybe rest for a time before they took their guns off 
to the creek or drove down the road towards town.   The women and 
children stayed at the <unk> The women, keeping their voices 
low as they worked around the house or sat in the living room, sounded 
like chickens shut up in a <unk> for the night. The children had to 
play away from the house (in the barn <unk> or the pasture behind the <unk> to maintain a proper <unk>   <unk> and on, all day, someone 
would be wiping at the <unk> gray dust that settled over everything. 
The <unk> cooler had been moved to <unk> room, and 
her door was kept <unk> so that the rest of the house stayed open, 
though there was a question as to whether it was hotter or cooler that 
way.   The dust <unk> their <unk> and the heat <unk> them, 
so that the women were always making ice water. They had cleaned 
up an old ice box and begun to buy <unk> blocks of ice in town, 
as the electric refrigerator came nowhere near providing enough ice for 
the crowds who ate and drank there.   One afternoon, as the women 
sat <unk> softly, a new <unk> of people pulled up at the <unk> 
It was a <unk> black <unk> with the dust of the road, its windows 
closed tight so you knew that the people who climbed out of it would 
be cool and <unk> They were an old fat couple (as Linda Kay 
described them to <unk> a thick middle-aged man, and a girl about 
ten or <unk>   There was much <unk> much <unk> <unk> <unk> Cousin <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> "And how is <unk> <unk> the same, John, 
about 
the <unk>   All the women got up and offered their chairs, and 
when they were all seated again, the guests made their inquiries and 
their <unk>   "We were on our vacation in <unk> <unk> explained, in a muffled voice that must have been used to <unk> 
"and the news didn't catch up with us till we were nearly home. 
We came on as soon as we <unk>   There was the suggestion 
of ice water, and- in spite of the protest "We're not really <unk> Linda <unk> to escape the <unk> air and the <unk> <unk> <unk> hurried to the kitchen.   She filled a big pitcher 
and set it, with <unk> on a <unk> <unk> it to the living room, 
she imagined the picture she <unk> tall and <unk> <unk> a bit sophisticated 
in her yellow <unk> with a graceful <unk> walk that she 
had learned as a <unk> with the school <unk> Almost immediately she 
was ashamed of herself for feeling <unk> at such a time, in such a 
place, and she tossed back her long yellow hair, smiling <unk> as she <unk> the room.   Howard (the thick middle-aged <unk> was looking 
at her. She felt the look and looked back because she could not help 
it, seeing that he was neither as old nor as thick as she had at first <unk>   "And who is this"? he asked, when she passed 
him a glass.   "Oh that's Linda <unk> Mama <unk> 
said <unk> "She married our baby boy, Bobby <unk> this <unk> see", Cousin Ada said. "He's a right smart <unk> than the <unk>   "Oh <unk> Mama laughed. "He's 
ten years younger than <unk> We didn't expect him to come <unk> thought for the <unk> he was a <unk>   This joke 
was not funny to Linda <unk> and she <unk> as she always <unk> 
then, hearing the muffled boom of <unk> laughter, <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> she asked Bobby Joe that 
night. "He makes me <unk>   "Oh he's a second <unk> or something. He got in the oil business out at <unk> and <unk> into some money".   "How old is <unk>   <unk> 
I don't know. <unk> I <unk> He's been married and 
got this <unk> <unk> If he <unk> you, don't pay him any mind. <unk> just a big <unk> Bobby Joe was thinking about something 
else. <unk> did you know they're fixing to have a <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk>   He was talking about <unk> 
again when they woke up. "Listen, I never had a chance to <unk> an <unk> There never was a season before, but now they want 
to thin 'em out on account of the <unk>   "Did he ever 
visit here when he was a <unk> Linda Kay asked.   <unk>   "Hell, I don't know. When he 
was a kid I wasn't <unk>   Bobby Joe took a gun from behind 
the door, and with a quick <unk> <unk> was gone for the <unk> immediately Howard and his daughter <unk> drove up in 
the <unk>   "We're going after <unk> Howard said, 
"and 
thought maybe you'd go along and keep us <unk>   There 
was really no reason to <unk> and Linda Kay had never ridden in 
a <unk>   <unk> along the <unk> road to town, Howard <unk> Finally he said, "Tell me about <unk> and Linda <unk> told him, because she thought herself that she had had an interesting 
life. She was such a <unk> <unk> having been a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and secretary of Future <unk> 
In her <unk> year she had started going steady with Bobby <unk> 
who was a football <unk> Future <unk> <unk> and president 
of Future <unk> It was easy to see that they were made for 
each other, and they knew what they <unk> Bobby Joe would be a senior 
this year, and he planned to <unk> But there was no need for <unk> Kay to go on, since all she wanted in life was to make a home 
for Bobby Joe and <unk> raise his children.   Howard sighed. 
"You lucky <unk> he said. "I'd give anything if I could 
have found a girl like you". Then he told Linda Kay about himself. 
Of course he couldn't say much, really, because of <unk> but <unk> Kay could imagine what kind of woman his wife had been and 
what a raw deal he had <unk> It made her feel different about <unk> was going to tell Bobby Joe about how mistaken she had <unk> but he brought one of the cousins home for supper, and all they 
did was talk about <unk>   Bobby Joe was trying to get Linda <unk> to say she would cook one if he brought it home.   <unk> 
a whole <unk> she <unk> "Why, I couldn't even cook 
a piece of <unk> <unk> I never even saw <unk>   "Oh, 
you could. I want to roast the whole thing, and have it for the <unk> Kay told him he couldn't do anything like that 
with his Grandma dying, and he said well they had to <unk> didn't <unk> they weren't all dying. Linda Kay felt like going off to the 
bedroom to <unk> but they were going up to the Big House after supper, 
and she had to put on a clean dress and fix her hair a <unk> night they all went to Mama and Papa <unk> and 
sat on the open front porch, where they could get the <unk> It was <unk> (or a little <unk> and nearly light as day. They all 
sat around and drank ice water, and the men <unk> and everybody had 
a good time. Once in a while they said what a shame it was, with <unk> <unk> but they all agreed she wouldn't have wanted it any other 
way.   That night the older men got to talking about going <unk> 
on a moonlight night. Bobby Joe and two or three of the 
other boys declared they had never been <unk> and Uncle Bill <unk> (from Mama <unk> side of the <unk> said he would 
just get 
up from there and take them, right then.   After they 
had left, some of the people moved around, to find more comfortable places 
to <unk> There were not many chairs, so that some preferred to sit 
on the edge of the porch, resting their feet on the ground, and others 
liked to sit where they could lean back against the wall. <unk> 
who had been sitting against the wall, said he needed more fresh air, 
and took the spot on the edge of the porch where Bobby Joe had been <unk>   "You'll be a <unk> sight more comfortable there, <unk> <unk> said, laughing, and they all laughed.   Linda <unk> felt that she was not exactly more comfortable. Bobby Joe had 
been sitting close to her, touching her <unk> and holding her hand 
from time to time, but it seemed at once that Howard sat much closer. 
Perhaps it was just that he had so much more flesh, so that more of 
it seemed to come in contact with <unk> but she had never been so aware 
of <unk> flesh before.   Still she was not sorry he sat 
by her, but in fact was <unk> He had become the center of the <unk> such stories he had to <unk> He had sold oil stock to Bob Hope 
and <unk> <unk> in <unk> he had helped fight an <unk> fire 
that raged six days and <unk> tell me, doctor, where do you plan to conduct the <unk> <unk> asked.   "That will have to be in the <unk> 
the doctor <unk> <unk> Alex's <unk> "What I 
want you to do is to go to the market with me early tomorrow morning 
and help <unk> the hen back into the <unk>   The doctor paid 
the bill and they repaired to the hotel, room number <unk> to <unk> <unk> further into these <unk>   The doctor opened 
the smallest of his cases, an <unk> straw bag, and exposed the contents 
for Alex's <unk> <unk> carefully packed in <unk> 
were six eggs, but the eye of a poultry <unk> was required to detect 
what <unk> valuable <unk> lay <unk> to Alex 
they were merely six not unusual <unk> <unk> There was little enough 
time to contemplate them, <unk> in an instant the doctor was <unk> 
across the room with an antique <unk> in his hands, thoroughly <unk> and big as a table top. He placed it on Alex's lap. 
"This is my hen <unk> he informed him in an absorbed way. "It's 
been going since <unk> when I was a junior in college. That first <unk> there is the Vermont <unk> the earliest and one of 
the most successful of my <unk> <unk> great big <unk> 
and hardly any <unk> at all. <unk> take them near a river, <unk> or they'd <unk> like a <unk> <unk> the day before <unk> <unk> was full of most precise <unk> 
date of <unk> length of <unk> period, number of <unk> reaching 
the first week, second week, fifth week, weight of hen, size of <unk> <unk> and so on, all <unk> out in a hand that looked more <unk> than English, the most <unk> and <unk> Alex had ever seen. <unk> these <unk> was a series of <unk> connected 
by <unk> and <unk> which denoted the <unk> of the <unk> Alex's <unk> was <unk> for the doctor had to go off to the <unk> <unk> de <unk> to hear more speeches with only time for one <unk> 
of wine to sustain him through them all. But after the doctor's return 
that night Alex could see, from the high window in his own room, 
the now familiar figure crouched on a truly impressive heap of <unk> 
apparently giving its <unk> powers one final chance before it 
was replaced in its office by a <unk> <unk>   A <unk> at <unk> door <unk> him at six o'clock the following morning. It 
was the doctor, dressed and ready for the expedition to the market, and <unk> was obliged to prepare himself in <unk> The doctor stood about, 
waiting for Alex to dress, with a show of <unk> and soon they 
were moving, as quietly as could be, through the <unk> <unk> 
past the bedroom of the <unk> and so into the street. The 
market was not far and, once there, the doctor's sense of <unk> 
left him and he fell into a state of harmony with the birds around him. 
He <unk> the <unk> and they responded with delighted <unk> he <unk> 
with the <unk> and they at once were all attention, he <unk> 
with the <unk> and <unk> with a pair of exceedingly <unk> <unk> 
The dawn progressed and it seemed that the doctor would never be 
done with his <unk> when quite abruptly something broke his <unk> 
It was a fine <unk> hen, white, with a <unk> eye and a striking <unk> of feathers in the under region of the <unk> The doctor, 
with the air of a man whose professional interests have found <unk> <unk> Alex's attention to those <unk> which might otherwise 
have escaped him: the fine color in <unk> and <unk> the length and 
quality of neck and saddle <unk> the firm, wide spread of the <unk> and a rare <unk> in the formation of the ear <unk> All search 
was <unk> he had found his <unk> The purchase was effected and 
they made their way towards the hotel again, the hen, with whom some 
sort of communication had been set up, <unk> in the doctor's <unk> clocks struck <unk> as they approached the hotel <unk> and hopes that the <unk> and <unk> would still 
be <unk> began to rise in Alex's well exercised <unk> The doctor 
was wearing a long New England <unk> hardly necessary in the <unk> weather but a <unk> which proved well adapted to the <unk> 
of <unk> Alex entered first and was followed by the doctor who, 
for all his care, manifested a <unk> <unk> on his left side where 
the hen was <unk> They advanced in a line across the entrance <unk> 
to the <unk> and up, with <unk> steps, towards the first <unk> 
It was then that they heard the <unk> of one descending and, in 
some <unk> glancing up, saw the <unk> coming towards them 
as they gained the <unk>   <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> she greeted them <unk> Alex explained that they had 
been out for a <unk> before breakfast while the doctor edged around 
behind him, attempting to hide the <unk> at his left side behind <unk> arm and back.   <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> de suite <unk> their hostess <unk> Alex told her that 
there was no hurry for their <unk> trying at the same time to 
effect a speedy separation of the persons before and behind him. The <unk> he <unk> was attempting a <unk> movement towards the stairs, 
but before the movement could be completed a distinct and <unk> <unk> <unk> the air in the hollow of the <unk> Eyes <unk> 
in the <unk> head, Alex <unk> <unk> and the doctor, 
with a <unk> of chicken <unk> floating behind him, took to the stairs 
in <unk> <unk>   <unk> <unk> the surprised <unk> looking at Alex for an explanation but he, <unk> from 
her without <unk> only offered a few words about the doctor's <unk> American speech and a state of nerves brought on by the demands 
of his work. With that he hurried up the stairs, followed by her <unk> <unk>   When Alex entered his room, the doctor was already <unk> a nest in the straw case, six eggs ready for the <unk> <unk> There was no reference to the incident on the stairs, his <unk> being absorbed by this more immediate business. The hen appeared 
to have no doubts as to her duties and was quick to settle down 
to the performance of them. One part of her audience was totally <unk> 
the <unk> witnessing a peculiarly fine performance of some <unk> <unk> the other part, the guest of the <unk> <unk> 
as one who must take an intelligent interest in that which he does 
not fully understand. The spectacle progressed towards a <unk> which 
was obviously still <unk> the audience <unk> Time <unk> 
but the doctor was obviously unconscious of its passage until an <unk> <unk> on the door interrupted the processes of nature. <unk> 
he jumped up to pull hen and case out of view, and Alex went to the 
door. He opened it a crack and in doing so made as much <unk> <unk> and scraping noise as possible in order to <unk> <unk> 
from the hen who had begun to <unk> It was <unk> the <unk> de <unk> come to clean the room, and while she stood before him with <unk> <unk> up and regard all <unk> explaining her <unk> Alex 
could see from the corner of his eye the doctor doing all he could 
to calm the displeased <unk> <unk> was reluctant but Alex succeeded 
in <unk> her to come back in five minutes and the door was shut 
again.   "Who was that, young <unk> the doctor instantly 
asked.   "That was the <unk> de <unk> the one you thought 
couldn't get the eggs out. She looked mighty <unk> though. <unk> she's coming back in five minutes to do the <unk> doctor's mind was working at a great <unk> he rose to put 
his <unk> on and addressed Alex in a <unk> voice.   "Have 
you got our keys <unk>   <unk> in my <unk> right. Now you go outside and <unk> me when it's <unk> 
The hall was empty and Alex <unk> they climbed the stairs 
which <unk> very loudly to their sensitive ears, and reached the next 
floor. A guest was locking his <unk> they passed behind him and 
got to Alex's room <unk> The doctor sat down rather <unk> <unk> the hen and <unk> that the city was not the place for a <unk> man, but no sooner was the remark out than a knock at this 
door obliged him to cover the hen with his <unk> once more. At 
the door Alex managed to persuade the increasingly <unk> <unk> 
de <unk> to return in ten minutes. It was evident that a second <unk> had to be <unk> and that it had to take place between the 
time the <unk> finished the doctor's room and the time she began <unk> They waited three minutes and then crept out on <unk> 
the <unk> were empty and they passed down the stairs to number nine 
and listened at the door. A <unk> of sheets being smoothed and <unk> 
being arranged indicated the <unk> de <unk> presence <unk> 
they listened and suddenly a step towards the door announced 
another important fact. The doctor shot down to the <unk> and turned 
the <unk> but to no <unk> the <unk> was <unk> Although 
a look of alarm passed over his face, he did not arrest his movements 
but disappeared into the shower room just as the <unk> emerged 
from number <unk> Alex <unk> those expressions of relief which <unk> to prevail in his face and escape from his <unk> <unk> 
they were in any case for, as he stood facing the <unk> de <unk> 
his ears were <unk> by new sounds from the interior of the shower <unk> The events of the last quarter of an hour, mysterious to 
any bird accustomed only to the <unk> life of <unk> and <unk> 
had overcome the doctor's hen and she gave out a series of <unk> <unk> 
perhaps mourning her <unk> but briefly <unk> The doctor's <unk> had not left him, however, for all his <unk> years, and the <unk> were almost immediately lost in the sound of water rushing out 
from the <unk> Alex nodded to the maid as though nothing unusual 
were taking place and entered the doctor's room. <unk> the doctor 
himself <unk> his hair somewhat wet from the <unk> but evidently <unk> with the outcome of their <unk> Without comment he 
opened the closet and from its shelves constructed a <unk> around 
the egg case which he had placed on the floor inside. Next, the hen 
was <unk> and all seemed well. The two men sat for some time, <unk> 
the pleasure of escape from <unk> and the relief such escape <unk> 
before they got up and left the hotel, the doctor to go to the conference 
house and Alex to go to the main post office.   Alex returned 
to the hotel, rather weary and with no new prospects of a role, 
in the late afternoon, but found the doctor in an <unk> <unk> At 
the time Alex arrived he was engaged in some sort of intimate communication 
with the hen, who had settled herself on the nest most <unk> 
after the occurrences of the morning.   <unk> have short <unk> the doctor <unk> <unk> why they are better company 
than most people I know", and he went on to break some important 
news to <unk> "Well", he began, "It seems like some people 
in Paris want to hear more from me than those <unk> over at the conference 
house do. They've got a big <unk> from <unk> at the <unk> here, with a wife for him, too, very rare birds, both of them, the 
only <unk> of their species outside Africa. <unk> like

who took <unk> May behind the barn and then didn't know what to <unk> and the people at the <unk> haven't got any <unk> <unk> to show 
for their <unk> downstairs with the <unk> Winston wished he could have 
given in to Miss <unk> but he knew better than to do what she said when 
she had that <unk> look. There were times it wasn't right 
to make a person happy, like the times she came in the kitchen and asked 
for a peanut butter <unk> "You know we don't keep peanut butter

"Can't you see I'm <unk> She looked at him <unk> over the corner of the <unk> is moving day", Winston reminded her, "and I bet

spread out the last list on the counter. "To Be <unk> <unk>

put her arms around his neck. "I don't want to leave here, <unk> listen to that". He drew back, <unk>

Although it had seemed a good <unk> to begin <unk> no couple could afford to have <unk> you going to work with a child hanging on you"? he asked <unk> "You want to keep this job, don't you"? He doubted 
whether she heard him, over the running water.   He sat for a

it was something to do with her back, the <unk> of it, and the <unk> <unk> way she <unk> She was too young, that was <unk> too young

He had on his gray <unk> <unk> and his city hat, and his brief 
case lay on the <unk> "I don't know what you think you've been

drove away, Winston went on looking out the window. He noticed a <unk> 
of dirt on the <unk> and <unk> at it with his <unk> Then he looked 
at his <unk> at the <unk> heavy <unk> and the thick <unk> he 
used like a knife to pry up, <unk> and open. For the first time, he 
let himself be sad about the move. That house was ten years off his life. 
Each brass handle and <unk> <unk> for his <unk> and he knew how 
to get at the dust in the <unk> flowers and how to take down the long <unk> drops which hung from the <unk> He knew the house like 
a blind man, through his fingers, and he did not like to think of all 
the time and <unk> and <unk> he had spent on keeping it up. <unk> years 
ago, he had come to the house to be <unk> The <unk> and the 
big pink <unk> had been blooming along the <unk> and he had walked 
up from the bus almost <unk> Miss Ada had been out back, in a straw <unk> <unk> flowers. She had talked to him right there, with the 
hot sun in his face, which made him sweat and feel <unk> Winston 
had been surprised at her for that. Still, he had liked the way she 
had <unk> in a <unk> neat cotton <unk> <unk> yellow, if he <unk> 
She had had a dignity about her, even <unk> and almost too <unk>   Since then, the flowers she had planted had spread all 
over the hill. Already the <unk> were blooming in a <unk> by the front <unk> and the <unk> were coming on, blue by the porch steps. 
In a week the <unk> would <unk> out. And the <unk> in early <unk> for Miss <unk> <unk> <unk> and after that the Japanese <unk> Now the yard looked wet and <unk> the trees bare under their <unk> but in a while Miss <unk> flowers would bloom like a marching <unk> She had dug a hole for each <unk> each tree wore a <unk> with 
her writing on it; where would she go for her <unk> now? Somehow <unk> didn't think she'd take to window <unk>   <unk> 
he hurried to the living room. He had a thousand things to see 
to. Still, he couldn't help thinking, we're all getting old, getting <unk> the <unk> is pulling in her <unk>   In the living <unk> Miss Ada was standing by the window with a <unk> of lists in 
her hand. She was looking out at the garden.   <unk> 
she said, <unk> the basket for the <unk>   Winston had 
the big straw basket ready in the hall. He brought it in and put 
it down beside her. Miss Ada was looking <unk> she had on her Easter <unk> blue, with <unk> <unk> <unk> across the house, he 
could have smelled her morning <unk> It hung in all her day clothes, 
sweet and <unk> sometimes when he was <unk> Winston raised 
her dresses to his face.   <unk> Miss Ada studied the list. 
"Well, let's see. The <unk> lemon tree. The <unk> <unk> <unk> followed her around the room, collecting the small frail <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> them

came to Mr& Jack's <unk> twenty by twelve inches in a <unk> <unk> <unk> Miss Ada said, "By rights I ought to leave that, 
seeing he won't take my <unk> She smiled at <unk> 
and he saw the <unk> hard glitter in her eyes. He picked up the photograph 
and began to <unk> it.   "At least you could leave it 
for the <unk> Miss Ada said. "What possessed you to tell me 
a <unk> would be a good <unk>   Winston folded the <unk> paper carefully. "He's used it every <unk> every morning, 
I lay out his clothes on it".   "Well, that's over now. 
And it was his main <unk> <unk> that fool picture out", she added <unk>   Winston laid it in the <unk> "Mr& Jack sets <unk> by that".   <unk> <unk> It was meant to be <unk> <unk> But she went on down the list.   Winston was <unk> those presents had been on his mind. He had only agreed 
with Miss Ada about getting the <unk> but he had actually suggested 
the photograph to Mr& Jack. "You know what she <unk> <unk> 
he had said <unk> one evening in November when Winston was <unk> off his <unk> "Tell me what to get her for <unk> been talking about a <unk> Winston had told 
him.   <unk> You mean picture of me"? But Winston 
had persuaded him.   On Christmas night, they had had a disagreement 
about it. Winston had heard because he was setting up the <unk> tray in the next room. Through the door, he had seen Mr& Jack 
walking around, waiting for Miss <unk> Finally she had come <unk> <unk> had heard her shaking out the skirt of her new pink silk <unk> gown.   "How do you like it"? she had <unk> Jack had said, "You look about fifteen years <unk> that a <unk>   "I don't know". He had

me feel <unk> Miss Ada had <unk> and she went sweeping and rustling 
to the couch and sank down.   "You look like that picture 
I have at the <unk> Mr& Jack had started. "Not a line,

up his photograph with the red Christmas bow still on it. <unk> 
an old man. Will you wear pink when you're <unk>   <unk> 
I love that <unk> I'm going to put it on my <unk> guess it's children make a woman old. A man gets

Miss Ada had said.   "No. All I want is a <unk> with 
a few lines. Make the man put them in if he has to".   After 
that they had sat for five minutes without saying a word. Then Miss <unk> had stood up, rustling and <unk> and gone <unk> <unk> it <unk> I had no doubt that it was. During the rest of the summer 
my scholarly <unk> for making plaster casts and <unk> <unk> of <unk> flowers and leaves was all but <unk> by the constantly <unk> impressions of Jessica that my mind served up to me for <unk> 
and <unk> <unk> in all the preceding years had 
had the power to bring me closer to a knowledge of profound sorrow than 
the <unk> of camp, the packing away of my camp <unk> the <unk> 
of ties with the six or ten people I had grown most to love in the 
world. In final separation from them, in the railroad terminal across 
the river from New York, I would nearly cry. My parents' <unk> 
arms would seem <unk> <unk> <unk> But that year was <unk> for just as the city, in the form of my street clothes, had <unk> upon my mountain nights, so an essential part of the summer 
gave promise of continuing into the <unk> Jessica and I, about to 
be separated not by a mere <unk> or <unk> kitchen but by the <unk> obstacle of residing in <unk> distant <unk> had agreed 
to <unk>   These letters became the center of my existence. 
I lived to see an envelope of hers in the morning mail and to lock <unk> in my room in the afternoon to <unk> her letter for the <unk> 
time and finally prepare an answer. My memory has <unk> for easy 
reference and <unk> the image of her pink, <unk> <unk> and 
the <unk> almost printed <unk> of her <unk> <unk> <unk> 
with which she invited me to recall our summer, so many sentences 
beginning with "Remember when <unk> and others concerning <unk> friends who <unk> in her suburban neighborhood, and news of her <unk> again her piano <unk> her private school, a visit to <unk> to see her <unk> and an uncle who was a surgeon returned 
on <unk> <unk> from the war in Europe.   In my letters 
I took on a personality that differed from the self I knew in real 
life. Then <unk> me was a foreign correspondent <unk> exciting <unk> and <unk> full of dash and wit and <unk> <unk> 
from the books I read, <unk> the grand styles of the authors recommended 
by a teacher in whose <unk> <unk> class I was <unk> 
The letters took their source from a stream of my imagination 
in which I was transformed into a young man not unlike my <unk> <unk> <unk> he of the porch steps <unk> who smoked <unk> 
performed the <unk> wore fifty dollar <unk> and sneaked off into 
the dark with girls to do <unk> things with them. Like <unk> 
in my <unk> I had a proud bearing and, with a skill that was vaguely <unk> I would lead Jessica through an evening of dancing 
and handsome descriptions of my newest <unk> would guide her gently 
to the night's climax which, in my <unk> was always represented 
by our almost suffocating one another to death with deep, moist <unk> 
burning with love. The night after reading her letter about her surgeon <unk> it must have been late in <unk> I had a vision 
of myself returned in ragged uniform from The <unk> nearly dying, 
my head <unk> and <unk> and Jessica <unk> over me, the power 
of her love bringing me back to life. For many nights <unk> the <unk> of her having been so close to me in that imagined bed would return 
and fill me with obscure and painful <unk> would cause me to lie <unk> in <unk> <unk> with <unk> longing to fall into a deep <unk>   The weeks went by, and the longer our separation <unk> 
the more <unk> and almost <unk> my <unk> <unk> They 
caused my love for Jessica to become <unk> and at the same time more <unk> as if my adolescent self knew that only <unk> would ever 
bring me the courage to ask to see her again.   As it turned out, <unk> took matters 
into her own hands. Having received permission 
to give a camp <unk> party, she asked that I come and 
be her date. I went and, <unk> and <unk> all but made a fool of myself. <unk> among those <unk> <unk> <unk> I was shy with <unk> and acted as I had during those early Saturday mornings when 
we all seemed to be playing for effect, to be detached and unconcerned 
with the girls who were properly our dates but about whom, later, in 
the <unk> of our <unk> we would think in terms of the most elaborate <unk> I remember standing in a corner, watching Jessica act the <unk> serving soft drinks to her guests. She was wearing her dark <unk> in two, thick <unk> to attain an "American <unk> effect 
she thought was appropriate to <unk> It made her look sweet and <unk> I was excited to be with her, but I did not know how 
to express it. Yet a moment did come that night when the <unk> 
letter writer and <unk> seemed to stride off my <unk> <unk> out 
of my mind, and plant himself in reality. It was late, we were playing <unk> games, and Jessica and I were called on to kiss in front 
of the others. We <unk> and were <unk> and it turned out to 
be the <unk> brush of lips upon cheek. The kiss <unk> our friends 
but it was done and meanwhile had released in me all the <unk> exciting <unk> of <unk> all the mysterious sensations that I had <unk> a truly <unk> kiss would convey to me.   It was 
at that party that, finally <unk> my <unk> inspired by tales 
only <unk> and <unk> among older boys, I asked <unk> 
to spend New Year's Eve with me. <unk> she accepted, and so 
great was my emotion that all I could think of saying was, "You're <unk> you <unk> Later, we agreed to think of how we wished 
to spend that night. We would write to one another and make a definite 
plan. She was terribly <unk>   Among my school and neighborhood <unk> during the next months, I <unk> and <unk> and <unk> described my <unk> date. But though I boasted and gave 
off a <unk> front, I was beneath it all <unk> It would be the 
first time I had ever been completely alone with a girl I loved. 
I had no idea of what subjects one discussed when alone with a girl, 
or how one <unk> Should I hold her hand while walking or only 
when crossing the <unk> Should I bring along a <unk> or send 
one to her? Was it <unk> to meet her at home or in the <unk> 
Should I accompany her to the door of her home, or should I ask to 
be invited <unk> In or out, should I kiss her <unk> All this 
was unknown to me, and yet I had dared to ask her out for the most 
important night of the <unk>   When in one letter Jessica informed 
me that her father did not like the idea of her going out alone 
on New Year's <unk> I knew for a moment an immense <unk> but 
the letter went <unk> she had <unk> she had <unk> she had been miserable

my closed door I was dressing as carefully as a <unk> I wore a new <unk> brown <unk> suit with a faint <unk> design

I had been <unk> <unk> in an <unk> of rough blue <unk> 
I was given a proud farewell by my mother and father, and I set out 
into the strangely still streets of <unk> I felt superior to the <unk> friends I was leaving <unk> felt older than my years, 
and was full of <unk> for myself as I headed into the subway that 
was carrying its <unk> of passengers out of that dull <unk> and 
into the <unk> <unk> excitement of <unk>   Times <unk> when I <unk> to it with my fellow subway <unk> <unk> <unk> as if for a huge wedding in a family of which we were all distant <unk> was nearly <unk> the <unk> <unk> with <unk> 
with <unk> up <unk> and soldiers already <unk> their girls 
and their <unk> bottles of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> sat <unk> noble horses along the <unk> to prevent the <unk> from <unk> out in front of the crawling traffic. The night 
was cold but the crowd kept one <unk> The giant electric signs and <unk> were lit up for the first time since <unk> regulations had 
been <unk> and the atmosphere was alive with the feeling that 
victory was just around the corner. <unk> <unk> <unk> 
for the unavailable tin models, were being <unk> and bought at makeshift 
stands every few yards along <unk> and one's ears were continually <unk> by the <unk> <unk> and <unk> An old gentlemen 
next to me held a <unk> <unk> <unk> to his lips and <unk> away at 
every fourth step and during the interim shouted out, <unk> for <unk> 
His neighbors <unk> him on. There was a great sense of <unk> How did one join them? Where were they all walking <unk> Was I supposed to buy a funny hat and a <unk> for <unk> was a quarter of seven when the crowd washed me up among the 
other <unk> who had established the <unk> steps as the <unk> 
from which to launch their night of <unk> I looked over their <unk> and felt a <unk> they all looked so much more knowing than <unk> I looked away. I looked for Jessica to <unk> out of the <unk> <unk> crowd and, as the time passed and I <unk> a <unk> 
came to life beside me and whispered in my <unk> How was I planning 
to greet <unk> Where exactly would we go after the <unk> <unk> the lines in front of the movie houses were too long and we 
couldn't get <unk> Suppose I hadn't brought along enough <unk> 
I felt for my <unk> Its thick, substantial outline <unk> <unk> when I saw that it was already ten past <unk> I began to <unk> if something had gone wrong. Suppose her father had changed his 
mind and had refused to let her <unk> Suppose at this very moment 
her father was calling my house in an effort to cancel the <unk> 
I grew <unk> All about me there was a <unk> interplay of meetings 
taking place, like <unk> <unk> scenes in old silent movies, <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> enthusiastic <unk> 
into the <unk> night. <unk> <unk> were taking up new positions on 
the steps, arriving and <unk> while I stayed <unk> like a <unk> 
to one <unk>   At <unk> two hotel <unk> came <unk> 
down the steps, carrying a <unk> to be set up as a <unk> in front 
of the <unk> store window next to the <unk> and as I 
watched them in their <unk> red coats that nearly scraped the ground, 
their <unk> fringed <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> I suddenly 
saw just over their shoulders Jessica gracefully making her way through 
the crowd. My heart almost stopped <unk> were <unk> patients on the bus the morning I left 
for Hanover, most of them disturbed and <unk> An <unk> 
a nurse and two <unk> were in charge of us.   I felt lonely 
and depressed as I stared out the bus window at Chicago's <unk> <unk> West <unk> It seemed <unk> as I listened to the <unk> <unk> of voices and smelled the <unk> <unk> coming from the <unk> 
that technically I was a ward of the state of Illinois, going to 
a hospital for the mentally <unk>   I suddenly thought of Mary <unk> <unk> the way her pretty eyes could flash with anger, her quiet <unk> the <unk> and <unk> that lay just beneath the <unk> of her <unk>   We had become good friends during my 
stay at Cook County <unk> I had told her enough about myself 
to offset somewhat the <unk> stories that had appeared in local newspapers 
after my little adventure in Marshall Field + <unk> She 
knew that I lived at a good address on the <unk> <unk> that I had 
once been a medical student and was thinking of returning to the university 
to finish my medical studies. She knew also that I was <unk> 
and without a single known <unk> She wasn't quite sure that 
I felt enough <unk> about my drinking, or that I would not return 
to it once I was out and on my own again. This had worried <unk> read those newspaper stories about you", she had said. "You 
must have loved that girl very much, but you couldn't have meant 
it when you said that you wanted to kill her".   "Why do you 
say that"? I asked. "I was full of <unk> and, well, a drunk 
is apt to do anything he says he'll do".   <unk> I grew 
up in an Irish neighborhood on Chicago's West <unk> Don't 
tell me about <unk> You're not the kind to go <unk> <unk> you 
in love with that <unk>   "Would it make any difference to 
you if I were, Mary <unk>   She met my eyes, suddenly <unk> "I wouldn't have gone into nursing if I didn't care about <unk> I'm interested in every patient I've helped take care <unk> When I think of people like you, well, <unk>   "You <unk> Mary <unk>   "You are young, intelligent, have a

I don't blame that girl for breaking her engagement with you. Was

should I? I've 
worked this ward for three months now. We keep getting the same 
ones back again and again. They all mean well, have great promises to 
make when they are about to go home, but drinking is their <unk> <unk> not seemed like them, but maybe you are. You've treated 
your stay here like a big <unk> It's not a joke to be sent to a place 
like this or to <unk> I wanted to go to college, <unk> didn't you"? I asked. <unk> has some of the <unk> eyes flashed <unk> "That's what I mean about 
you, <unk> she said. "You don't seem to know much about <unk> I'll tell you why I didn't go to <unk> I'm 
the oldest of six children. My father's a policeman and makes less 
than seven thousand dollars a year. There was no money for <unk> 
for clothes, for all the things you apparently take for <unk> <unk> 
training here doesn't cost anything. They even pay me six dollars 
a month. I think it's a good deal. I'm going to become a good <unk> and I've got two baby brothers that are going to have college 
if I have to work at my profession until I'm an old maid to give 
it to them".   "Do you have a boy <unk> I <unk> none of your business", she said, then changed 
the subject. "What about your father and mother, don't you think 
of them when you're in a place like this"?   "My father 
and mother died when I was two years <unk> I said. "My <unk> raised 
me. Aunt Mary died when I was doing my military service. I have 
no one but myself to worry <unk>   Something in my voice must 
have touched her deeply because her anger passed quickly, and she 
turned away to keep me from seeing her face.   "I'm <unk> 
she said. "I don't know what I'd do without my family. We've 
always been so <unk>   "Tell me more about <unk> 
eyes became bright as she talked about her father and mother, <unk> 
and <unk> <unk> <unk> I felt <unk> and lonely as only an <unk> can. When she had finished I said:   "Your <unk> sounds 
like a good father and a good <unk> I'll bet he wouldn't 
be pleased if a <unk> like me were to ask his daughter for a <unk> 
I mean, after I'm out of the hospital, a month or so from <unk> father is a sergeant of detectives and has been attached 
to <unk> for five years. He's a pretty good judge of character, <unk> I don't think he'd mind too much if he were sure you'd 
decided not to be a <unk> in the future".   "What about <unk> How would you feel about it if I were to ask you for a date 
when I get through at <unk>   "If I thought you 
were serious about going back to school, that you'd learned something 
from your experiences here and at <unk> well, I might consider 
such an <unk> What about your **h that girl you were going to <unk> suddenly seemed very important to me that Mary Jane <unk> should know the truth about me- that I was not the <unk> <unk> <unk> person she believed me to be.   "There 
are things about me that I can't tell you now, Mary <unk> I 
said, "but if you'll go out to dinner with me when I get out of Hanover, 
I'd like to tell you the whole story. I can say this: I'm 
dead serious about going back to school. As for that other girl, 
let's just say that I never want to see her again. You will get

to the <unk> Beach Hotel for <unk> I said. "Do you like 
to <unk> They always have a good <unk>   "I like 
to <unk> she said, then turned and walked away.   There hadn't 
been anything really personal in her interest in me. I knew that. 
It was just that she felt deeply about every patient on the ward 
and wanted to believe that they might benefit from their treatment <unk> riding this hospital <unk> feeling isolated and utterly <unk> I knew that she was genuine and <unk> quite unlike any girl 
I had known before. It seemed the most important thing in my life 
at this moment that she should know the real truth about me.   It 
was a fantastic story. Only two people in the state of Illinois knew 
that I was entering Hanover State Hospital under an assumed name, 
or why. It was unlikely that any girl as sharp as Mary Jane <unk> 
would believe it without <unk> But I had the <unk> all documented 
in a legal agreement which I would show her the moment I was free 
to do so.   As the bus turned into the main highway and headed 
toward Hanover I settled back in my seat and closed my eyes, thinking 
over the events of the past two weeks, trying to put the pieces in <unk> I wondered suddenly as I listened to the <unk> <unk> 
coming from the patient behind me, if I had not perhaps imagined 
it all. Perhaps this was reality and <unk> Nelson, the <unk> was <unk> a <unk> of Carl <unk> imagination. <unk> 
had come to Chicago from New York early in September with a dramatic 
production called <unk> <unk> It was a bad play, real <unk> <unk> which only a <unk> of <unk> with <unk> dreams of <unk> gain and tax money to burn could have put into <unk> No <unk> not even the <unk> had any real hope of getting it back to <unk> 
But because it was a <unk> <unk> story of the <unk> <unk> many of us felt that it might catch on for a run in Chicago, continue 
as a road company, and eventually become a <unk>   Such optimism 
was completely <unk> The critics literally screamed their <unk> <unk> <unk> was doomed from the moment <unk> leveled 
on it in his <unk> column. We opened on Friday and 
closed the following Monday. Out of the entire cast I alone received 
good notices for my portrayal of a <unk> <unk> This let me 
in for a lot of <unk> from the rest of the company, two members of 
which were native <unk>   We were paid off Tuesday morning 
and given tickets back to New York.   I felt lonely and depressed 
as I packed my bags at the <unk> Hotel. It seemed to me that 
my life was destined to be one brilliant failure after another. I 
had been among the top third in my class at <unk> had wanted <unk> to go to medical school, but I'd run out of money and 
energy at the same time. Then later I had quit my <unk> secure <unk> 
spot on a network soap opera to take a part in this play. It 
seemed to me that I was not only <unk> but quite stupid as well. I 
knew that I'd soon be back working as an orderly at the hospital 
or as a <unk> at Union News or <unk> while waiting for another <unk> job to open. It suddenly occurred to me that I did not particularly 
like <unk> that I was at some sort of crossroads and would 
have to decide soon what I was going to do with my life.   I 
closed the last bag and stood all three at the door for the <unk> 
to pick up, then went to the <unk> for a drink of water. The telephone <unk> When I answered it a voice too <unk> and British to 
be real said, "Is this Mr& <unk> Nelson, the <unk> <unk> right", I said. "Why don't you bastards lay off for a <unk>   "I beg your <unk> <unk>   "All right. 
This is <unk> Nelson **h the <unk>   <unk> I'm <unk> you, Mr& Nelson, at the request of Mr& <unk> <unk> <unk> you possibly have lunch with him <unk> His car could pick 
you up at your hotel at <unk>   I smiled. "You'll send 
the <unk> of <unk>   "Yes, of course, Mr& <unk>   I started to say something else <unk> but 
the man had hung up.   I finally went downstairs to the bar off 
the main lobby where most of the cast were <unk> their <unk> over 
the <unk> passing of <unk> <unk> They all <unk> low as I approached 
them.   "All right, you <unk> I said, "the great <unk> is about to buy a <unk>   I laid a <unk> on the <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> to serve a <unk> He had just returned 
my change when the <unk> came in off the street to page me. I 
walked over to him.   "You Mr& <unk> he <unk> right".   "Mr& <unk> car is waiting 
for you at the east <unk>   I followed him out through the <unk> to the street.   An ancient <unk> as <unk> <unk> as the day it came off the ship, was parked at the <unk> The <unk> <unk> <unk> in a dark <unk> stood stiffly at attention 
holding open the door of the town <unk> was giving the parked cars the <unk> The <unk> with

the deal on the office in this <unk>   I walked with 
him back to the entrance. He gave me a ticket on the agency car and <unk> it.   I was back in ten minutes. <unk> to get something 
out of the <unk> I told him, showing him my <unk>   He 
started to say something as I walked in and then suddenly grinned and 
said, "Oh, yes. You're the one I was talking to about a monthly <unk>   "That's right", I told him.   He consulted 
the parking <unk> then looked at a <unk> and said, "You're 
in the third row back toward the rear. Can you find it all <unk> I told him.   I went back to the agency 
car and got out an electric <unk> one of the newest devices for electronic <unk> I always keep a set in the car.   I put in new <unk> so as to be certain I'd have plenty of power and on my way 
out walked over to the regular parking <unk> and stood looking at 
them <unk>   I waited until the parking attendant was busy 
with a <unk> then slipped around the back of the car with license 
number <unk> <unk> attached the electronic <unk> to the rear <unk> 
and walked out.   The attendant waved me on.   One of the <unk> chores a detective has is hanging around on a city street, trying 
to make himself <unk> keeping an eye on the entrance of 
an office building and waiting.   For the first fifteen or twenty 
minutes it's possible to be more or less interested in window <unk> 
then in people passing by. After a while, however, a <unk> 
mind gets fed up and that <unk> all of the <unk> physical <unk> which go with that sort of an assignment. You want to sit down. 
Your leg muscles and back muscles feel <unk> You're conscious 
of the fact that your feet <unk> that the city <unk> are <unk> waited a solid two hours before my man came out of the office <unk> He came out alone.   I wasn't far behind him when 
he entered the parking lot and hurried over to his car.   The attendant 
recognized me once more and said, "What did you do about that <unk>   "I haven't made up my mind <unk> I said. 
"It's a <unk> I have a couple of them I'm figuring <unk> 
one here and one that's out quite a ways where there's usually curb <unk>   "That curb parking is <unk> and <unk> 
particularly when it <unk> he said.   I kept trying to 
get him to take my money. <unk> I told him. "I'm in a rush 
right now. I know where the car is. <unk> me to drive it <unk> have one of the boys get it", he said. "It's 
one 
of the rules on <unk> <unk> drive out their own <unk> it as <unk> as you can, will you"? I asked. <unk> that's all right", he said. "You're going to be a <unk> 
You'll get in the office building here. You don't want to <unk> a place way out in the <unk> You get business where the business 
is, not where it <unk>   I grinned at him, handed him 
a couple of dollars and said, "By the time you get the parking charge <unk> up, there should be a cigar in it for you".   I hurried 
over to the agency <unk> jumped in, started the motor and was just 
in time to see the car I wanted to shadow turn to the left. 
I was held up a bit trying to make a left turn. By the time I'd 
made it he was gone. Traffic was pretty <unk>   I turned on the <unk> <unk> and the signal came in loud and clear.   I made 
time and picked him up within ten <unk> I stayed half a block behind 
him, letting lots of cars keep in between us, listening to the steady <unk> **h <unk> **h <unk>   After fifteen minutes of traffic driving 
he turned to the left. I couldn't see him, but the electric <unk> 
device gave steady <unk> when it was straight ahead, short half <unk> when the car I was following was to the left, and long <unk> <unk> when it turned to the right. If it ever got behind me, the <unk> 
turned to a <unk>   I turned left too soon and got a signal showing 
that I was still behind him but he was to the right. After a 
while the signal became a <unk> and I knew he was behind me. That meant 
he'd parked <unk> I made a big circle until I located the 
car parked at the curb in front of an apartment house.   I found 
a parking place half a block away, sat in the car and waited. 
My <unk> was in the apartment house for two hours. Then he came out 
and started driving toward the beach.   By this time it was dark. 
I could get up close to him where there was traffic but had to drop 
far behind when there wasn't traffic. My lights would have been a <unk> if I'd tried to shadow him in the conventional manner. Moreover, 
I'd have lost him if it hadn't been for the electronic <unk> 
device **h. His signal was coming loud and clear and then all 
of a sudden it turned to a <unk> I circled the block and found he was 
in the parking lot of a <unk> restaurant.   I sat where 
I could watch the <unk> and realized I was <unk> I sat there with 
the faint odor of <unk> <unk> <unk> my <unk> and <unk> catching the <unk> of coffee.   My man came out an <unk> later, drove to the beach, turned right and after half a mile went 
to the <unk> and <unk> <unk>   It was a fairly modern motel with 
quite a bit of electrical display in front. I remembered it was the <unk> Tom place.   I waited until my man was coming out of 
the office with the key to a cabin before I went in to <unk> card the man I was <unk> had filled out was still on the <unk> I noticed that he was in Unit 12 and that he had registered 
under the name of Oscar L& Palmer and wife, giving a San Francisco <unk>   He had written out the license number of his car 
but had <unk> the last two figures, an old dodge which is still <unk> <unk> times out of a hundred the motel manager doesn't 
check the license number on the plates against the license number the <unk> writes out. If he does, it's still better than an even chance 
he won't notice the <unk> of the numbers, and if he should 
notice it, the thing can be passed off as an honest <unk> 
I used the <unk> of Robert C& <unk> gave the first three letters 
and the first and last figure of the license number on the agency <unk> but a couple of phony numbers in <unk>   I could have 
written anything. The manager of the motel was a woman who apparently 
didn't care. She was <unk> with the law in regard to <unk> 
but she certainly wasn't <unk> license numbers or <unk> 
the <unk>   "You mean you're all alone, Mr& <unk> right".   "Your wife isn't going 
to join <unk> <unk>   "I don't think so".   "If 
you expect her to show up", she said, <unk> better put <unk> <unk> on there. It's a <unk> you know".   <unk> 
difference in the <unk> I asked.   "Not to you", she said <unk> "It's ten dollars either way. There are ice <unk> in 
a container at the far end and in another by the office. There are 
three <unk> <unk> machines, and if you should be joined <unk> <unk> 
try to keep things quiet, if you will. We like to run a nice <unk> place".   "Thank you", I told her.   I took 
another <unk> glance at the other registration <unk> then took the 
key to Unit 13 that she had given me and went down long enough to park 
the car.   The construction was reasonably <unk> not like 
the <unk> construction of so many of the motel units that have <unk> 
all over the outside but walls that are thin enough so you can hear 
every movement of the people in the adjoining apartment.   I 
put a small electric <unk> against the wall on the side I wanted 
to case. With the aid of that I could hear my man moving around, heard 
him <unk> a couple of times, heard the toilet <unk> heard the sound 
of water <unk>   <unk> his companion was going to be, she 
was going to join him later. She knew where to come. He didn't have 
to <unk>   I was so hungry my stomach felt all lines of <unk> had been <unk> It's one thing to go without food 
when you're occupied with some work or when you're simply <unk> 
a <unk> but when you're dependent on someone else and know that you <unk> eat until he's <unk> down for the night, hunger can 
be a <unk> <unk>   I had noticed a <unk> down the road a <unk> of a <unk> The <unk> on the <unk> device I had put on 
the car were still fresh enough to send out good strong <unk> The 
powerful <unk> I could press against the wall between my motel <unk> and that occupied by the man would bring in the sound of any conversation, 
and I was positively <unk> I was so <unk>   I 
got in the car, drove down to the <unk> and ordered a couple of <unk> 
with everything <unk> a cup of coffee and the fastest service <unk>   The place wasn't particularly busy at that time 
of night, and the girl who was waiting on me, who was <unk> in the <unk> pair of <unk> I had ever seen on a woman and a sweater 
that showed everything there was- and there was lots of it- wanted 
to be <unk>   "You really in a hurry, <unk> 
she asked.   "I'm in a hurry, <unk>   "It's 
early in the evening to be in a <unk> There's lots of time <unk> <unk> may not be any women <unk> I said.   She gave 
a little <unk> and said, <unk> don't get off work until eleven <unk> That's when my evening <unk>   "I'll 
be here at <unk> I said.   "Oh, <unk> she <unk> "That's what they all say. What's that thing going <unk> in your <unk>   I said <unk> it, that's 
the automatic signal that shows when the <unk> key is on. I didn't 
turn it off". I reached over and switched off the electronic <unk> <unk>   She went in to get the <unk> and I switched 
on the device again and kept the signal from <unk> car coming 
in steady and clear until I saw her starting back with the <unk> 
Then I shut off the device again.   She wanted to hang around 
while I was <unk> "Don't you think it's selfish to have 
dinner <unk> you go to pick her <unk>   "No", I said. 
"It's a <unk> to her. You see, she's on a <unk> <unk> <unk> just a pineapple and cottage <unk> salad and I'm to have one 
with her so she won't feel out of place".   <unk> can be <unk> the girl said. "How much <unk> is <unk> a <unk> I said, "but she's keeping her figure in <unk> looked at me <unk> "Good figures <unk> 
be kept in <unk> she said, and walked away with an exaggerated <unk>   I turned on the device again, half fearful that I might 
find silence, but the <unk> came in loud and clear.   When I <unk> on the lights for her to come and get the <unk> I had the 
exact change plus a dollar <unk> fat man said, "All we <unk> do is go around the <unk> gun <unk> The thin man said, <unk> second building on the right".   <unk> it says police 
right on the <unk>   <unk> so even if we was as dumb as you 
take us for, we could still find it".   <unk> and Dave began 
to back toward the door. The thin man waved the gun again. He said, <unk> around the <unk>   "It says water works, but 
there is a policeman on <unk> <unk>   "A night policeman just 
like in the States. You <unk>   <unk> doesn't have 
much of this here juvenile <unk> problem, but we keep a night <unk> all the same on account of the crazy <unk>   At 
the door, Dave paused to feel for the <unk> <unk> glanced up at 
her husband. He was going to be sensible and not try to do anything <unk> with that gun pointed at him. She measured the distance from where 
they stood to the men and the gun, measured the distance from the 
men to the back room. She decided to risk it. There was something phony 
about all this gun <unk> something not quite what it seemed in 
the detailed directions for finding the police.   Dave had the <unk> under his thumb now and he removed his arm from his wife in order 
to pull the door open. In a flash she was away to the back, paying 
no attention to three angry <unk> from the male <unk> She tore open 
the back door. It was dark inside the room but enough light <unk> 
from the restaurant behind her to enable her to make out a round table 
with a green cloth top. There was a small <unk> with some empty <unk> bottles on it and perhaps fifteen wooden <unk>   <unk> 
she turned to face the men again. <unk> at the counter was on his <unk> The distance between where she stood and where Dave waited at 
the outside door was a hundred miles. <unk> her frightened gaze on 
the men at the counter, she began to feel her way to the door. She <unk> along the <unk> one step at a time. The gun followed <unk> she reached Dave and felt his arm go around her, felt him pull 
her to the safety of his person, she knew with the certainty of despair 
that something bad had happened to <unk>   The two 
men watched as Dave closed the door behind them, watched them cross the <unk> to their car. It was getting light. The fat man removed 
his <unk> put on a greasy and wrinkled <unk> and <unk> it over his <unk>   The thin man moved swiftly to the phone and <unk> a <unk> When he was answered, he said, <unk> <unk> I'm sending 
you a couple of <unk> <unk> just get them out of my hair

more thing- <unk> <unk> closed at eleven like always last night

or <unk> I think it was called <unk> <unk> <unk> yesterday. <unk> it"?   He turned from the phone and strode to 
the front of the restaurant. The white <unk> hadn't moved away yet. <unk> A line of worry formed, a <unk> pulled his mouth over to one 
side.   He said, <unk> You ain't <unk> me- the <unk> don't know the name of this <unk>   "I ain't <unk> 
you, <unk> How could <unk> She <unk> been walking in her <unk>

he couldn't have seen the narrow, pointed face of his companion suddenly <unk> with <unk> but he was aware of it just the same. He knew <unk> <unk> was one of those men who had to work up a fury once

"Why does everything have to happen to me"?   Grosse <unk> got a <unk> and started to sweep up the <unk> Vince watched

Once he said, <unk> hell didn't you look in the back

she couldn't understand their subsequent <unk> Was it because

His <unk> were <unk> by <unk> of <unk> <unk> His small, mean eyes

them. As he <unk> his gum and <unk> <unk> breath, Marty <unk> 
the <unk> of bad <unk>   Marty recognized the man. He had driven 
the car that passed them on the road outside <unk> place. 
This was <unk> <unk> proprietor of the <unk> <unk>   Marty <unk> at <unk> pleasantly and said, "There was a cab waiting for

some cars here. I wonder if one of you gentlemen could drive me back 
to <unk> I'd be happy to pay for the <unk> of <unk> seventeen men stood and stared at him for a moment longer. And 
then a startling thing occurred. It was so utterly unexpected that <unk> stood for several moments with his mouth hanging open <unk> 
after it had happened.   There was no word <unk> no apparent <unk> given.   Yet the men all moved at the same <unk> piled into the waiting cars, <unk> <unk> the cars sped <unk> station wagon and the old <unk> headed east toward <unk> 
The Ford and the pickup truck sped west toward <unk> <unk>   In seconds all four cars were out of sight. <unk> Land stood alone on a <unk> road as storm clouds gathered <unk> 
in the sky again. From a great distance thunder <unk> and 
broke the silence.   Land looked back toward the <unk> house. 
He thought he saw a pale face at a window. Perhaps it was <unk> <unk> Perhaps she would be glad that they hadn't hurt him.   There 
were other <unk> <unk> Across the road there was one no 
more than a hundred yards away. There was another on this side, a little 
further down. There were many more between here and <unk> <unk> <unk> lined the road. They <unk> tall and <unk> Their <unk> stretched out into <unk> Not a single strand of wire reached 
into the silent houses beside the <unk> road.   There was 
nothing he could do but walk. And <unk> was more than three 
miles away, down an old dirt road that the rain had turned into a <unk> faced east and started walking down the left side 
of the road. After he had proceeded a few feet, he paused and turned 
up the <unk> of his <unk> which were already damp and <unk> 
The <unk> mud was <unk> and in places great <unk> spread across 
the road and reflected the <unk> light.   As he approached 
the first <unk> thunder sounded behind him again, closer now and <unk> like a steadily <unk> drum <unk> There were several people 
on the porch of the <unk> There was a very old man and a young 
woman and a brood of children ranging from <unk> to <unk> 
For just an instant he thought of appealing to them for help. Perhaps 
they had a car or truck and would drive him into town. Then he realized 
the utter futility of the idea. They were staring at him in the same <unk> and <unk> way that the men outside the gate had <unk> Even 
the eyes of the smallest children seemed <unk>   On his 
side of the road there were two farm hands, well back in a field, leaning 
against a <unk> They, too, stared at him.   The drums of <unk> were right behind him now.   A foolish thought came into 
his head. He remembered a story he had read as a youth. It was probably 
one of <unk> tales of the British Army. It concerned an officer 
who had been <unk> and <unk> out. The steady roll of the drums 
had sounded behind him as he walked between the endless ranks of 
the men he had <unk> and each man <unk> and turned his back 
as the officer <unk> Marty wished these poor farm people would 
turn their <unk>   The <unk> by the <unk> ended. Now the <unk> highway was <unk> on either side by a fairly deep drainage <unk> 
too broad to leap over unless you were an Olympic <unk> The day's <unk> had been added to the stagnant water. He was trapped on the 
road when he heard the sound of an approaching car. It was coming toward 
him. The car was now in sight. <unk> heart skipped a beat when 
he recognized it. It was the station wagon that had passed his cab 
on the road, the station wagon that had been parked at the <unk> farm. <unk> <unk> station wagon. It had headed back toward <unk> 
That had only been a <unk> to lure him out on the deserted road. 
Now <unk> and his friends were returning to seek him out. 
The station wagon came to a stop a couple of hundred feet in front of 
him, beside a <unk> field. Then there was another sound. A second 
car was coming from the west, from the direction of <unk> <unk> 
It was the Ford that had been outside <unk> farm.   Marty 
looked <unk> in both directions. It was a narrow road, barely <unk> enough for two cars to <unk> He could not leave the road because 
of the <unk> drainage <unk> When the two cars were <unk> 
from him, the station wagon started up again and the Ford gathered <unk> They bore down on him. There was nothing he could do except <unk> into the <unk>   He <unk> and sank to his knees in muddy <unk>   As the two cars roared by, there was a high-pitched <unk> <unk> sound. Marty knew how the Union soldiers must 
have felt at <unk> and <unk> and <unk> when the <unk> gray ranks charged at them, screaming the wild <unk> <unk> they 
called the Rebel <unk>   For moments he stood in water, shivering 
and <unk> for breath. He had turned his ankle slightly, and it <unk> him. The cars, with their load of <unk> men, had disappeared 
in the distance. There had been two more cars parked at the <unk> 
a <unk> and a pickup truck. They would be coming for him next, bearing 
down on him from both directions. And then the station wagon and 
the Ford would seek him out again. He would be <unk> repeatedly 
and would escape death by inches time after time, all the way to <unk> 
He still had three miles to go. Back East the more <unk> <unk> <unk> who could afford <unk> <unk> instead of <unk> blades as <unk> weapons, played this same game and called it <unk>   He could not go through the fields. That way 
was barred on both sides of the road by a high <unk> fence. He 
had to make for the section of road just ahead that was <unk> by the <unk> <unk> the section by the <unk> At least he could climb 
up on the fence when his <unk> roared by again. The <unk> place 
could not be far now. He would go in there, climb through the window, 
and at least be safe for a little while and able to rest. There 
was even a bare chance that the phone had not been <unk> did not dare climb back up to the road. He was deep in water, but 
at least they could not reach him there. He <unk> on, mud sucking 
at his feet with each step, until he reached the end of the drainage <unk> and the beginning of the fence that enclosed the farm. He climbed 
back to the road, and he felt utterly <unk> He <unk> <unk> 
for a moment. And then he saw something that he had not seen before, 
and panic gripped him again.   The <unk> his only <unk> when 
the metal death came roaring at him, was made of <unk> all right, 
but the rails were protected by a thick <unk> of barbed wire that 
would <unk> his flesh if he pressed against it. He <unk> on down the 
road <unk> because there was no place else to go.   He lost 
all sense of <unk> You could not stand on dignity when you were <unk> and <unk> and your life was at <unk> Probably people were <unk> him from the porch or from behind the windows of this <unk> 
too, but he did not bother to look. He broke into a <unk> breathing <unk> streaming with <unk> He had to reach <unk> place. 
It was his only <unk> The fences on both sides of the road <unk> with the barbed <unk> The fences stretched on <unk> then he heard them.   And now he saw them.   The <unk> was coming at him from the east, the pickup truck from the <unk> 
They had timed it better this time. They would reach him at almost 
exactly the same <unk> He stopped <unk> If he backed 
against the <unk> one of the cars would brush him as it passed, and he 
would be <unk> <unk> by the <unk>   He stumbled to the middle 
of the road and simply stood there, waiting for them, a perfect <unk>   The cars must have had their gas <unk> pushed down to 
the floor boards. They were coming on at reckless speed for such old <unk> They <unk> at him. He held his arms close to his sides 
and made himself as small as possible. When the <unk> <unk> it <unk> toward him and seemed about to run him down. He forced himself 
to stay frozen there. If he moved, he would be in the path of the 
other car. He thought the <unk> of the <unk> brushed his jacket 
as it went by. In a fraction of a second the pickup truck <unk> by 
on the other side.   The <unk> insane sound of the Rebel yell <unk> again and echoed from the distant hills.   He did not 
leave the middle of the road. He did not try to run. He <unk> on, 
his aching eyes focused straight ahead. He was nearing the <unk> 
house. He was going to make it, he told himself. And then he heard 
a car coming from the east, and he felt as if he would break down and <unk>   "Oh, no, not again", he said <unk> "Not again so <unk>   There was a new sound, a sound as <unk> as the Rebel <unk> yet different. It was the sound of a <unk> Now he saw that 
the approaching car was painted white, and he began to wave his arms <unk> It was the <unk> car from the <unk> <unk> car drew up alongside him and stopped.   "Get <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk>   He staggered into the back seat 
and lay back, fighting for breath. There was someone in front with 
the <unk> It was Pete Holmes, the <unk>   Pete turned 
around and said to <unk> "I guess you think I'm a <unk> <unk> But there wasn't no use in me staying there. I couldn't 
fight a dozen or so of <unk> If I'd <unk> all that I'd have

was occupied with <unk> the car around in a very narrow space. 
When it was finally pointed east, he said, "You should never have 
come out here alone. This is <unk> country. Every man in every 
one of these houses is a Night <unk> he turned the telephone over to <unk> and went into the 
bedroom to change his <unk> for dry socks and shoes. Rourke was 
talking on the phone when he came back. <unk> an hour, <unk> Are 
you <unk> He listened a moment and then said, <unk> it". 
He turned his head and said, <unk> will definitely be in a back 
room at the <unk> <unk> Club on South Beach within an hour. <unk> 
to try and meet him there"?   Shayne looked at his watch. That 
wasn't too far from Fifth Street, and should allow him to make <unk> Bar by <unk> He said with <unk> "That's <unk> <unk> I'll be there".   Rourke confirmed the appointment 
over the phone and hung up. "I don't know what you're getting <unk> <unk> he said <unk> "I hope to Christ <unk> said <unk> <unk> another drink if you want it. We've

and took his hat from beside the door. Timothy Rourke <unk> down 
the whiskey hastily and joined him, asking, "Who are we going to call 
on in the Northeast <unk>   "A lady. That is, maybe 
not too much of a lady. At least, I want to find out whether she's 
home yet or not". He opened the door and followed Rourke <unk> <unk> car, Shayne drove east to <unk> Boulevard 
and north toward <unk> <unk> address which had been given to 
him by the <unk> <unk> As he <unk> he filled in Timothy Rourke <unk> on the events of the evening after leaving the reporter 
to go to the <unk> house, and on his own <unk>   "I want

number you gave me. Not more than a block or so".   Shayne 
got in the <unk> lane and cut across the Boulevard <unk> There 
was a small, <unk> restaurant and cocktail lounge on the southeast 
corner of the intersection as he turned into the quiet, <unk> 
street where most of the houses on both sides were older two-story <unk> now cut up into furnished rooms and housekeeping <unk> drove westward from the Boulevard slowly, letting Rourke <unk> his head out the window and watch for street numbers. A single <unk> was parked <unk> up the block on the <unk> side. <unk> noted <unk> that it carried Miami Beach license plates as he <unk> and then saw the <unk> of a match in the front seat as they <unk> indicating that it was <unk>   He turned to see 
the <unk> faces of two men in the parked car just as Rourke 
said, "It's the next house, <unk> On the right".   Instead 
of pulling into the <unk> Shayne increased his speed slightly to 
the corner where he swung left. He went around the corner and <unk> 
turning off his lights and <unk>   "I told you, <unk> said <unk> in an <unk> voice. "It was back there <unk> said, "I know it was, <unk> His voice was <unk> and <unk> "Did you see the car parked across the <unk>

in six or eight minutes later. The reporter nodded as he moved up beside 
him at the bar. Shayne told the <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
and Rourke told him, "It's those two, all right.

be waiting for you there".   The <unk> brought <unk> <unk> and Shayne laid a <unk> bill on the bar. He said in 
a low voice, "I've got a date with a lady, <unk> Will that

a <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> but liquor is <unk> **h

He turned away and returned in a moment with a pint of <unk> in

As the detective slid it into his pocket, Rourke asked <unk> "What

getting a <unk> ready to make the telephone call to the <unk> Shayne hesitated when he saw that Rourke had parked his <unk> directly in front of the bar headed <unk> He walked over to 
the right-hand door, opened it and got the <unk> automatic out of 
the glove compartment and put it in his hip pocket. He hoped he wouldn't 
be forced to use it in taking care of the Beach <unk> but 
its weight was comforting at his <unk> On this side of the <unk> Miami <unk> cops had no more legal rights than any ordinary <unk> and <unk> pistol permit was just as good as theirs.   He went <unk> up the sidewalk toward the parked car with the two Beach detectives 
in the front seat. He <unk> the <unk> of his hat low as he <unk> <unk> out into the street just behind the car and strode around 
to the right-hand side.   The big, <unk> man named <unk>

was <unk> loudly and trying to drag a gun from a shoulder <unk> 
somewhat <unk> by the steering wheel.   Shayne locked his big

street toward the opposite side.   Shayne <unk> across to <unk> 
the reporter in front of the two-story house where <unk> <unk> <unk> and asked <unk> "Get the police <unk> <unk> Said they'd have a patrol car here fast. Let's get inside.

where a dim <unk> burned high in the ceiling. A row of <unk> 
along the wall had numbers and names on them. Shayne found one marked <unk> <unk>   The <unk> on the right was dark, but 
there was a <unk> at the bottom which lighted another dim <unk> 
at the top, and they went up.   There were two front rooms, both 
dark behind their <unk> and there was no sound or light in the entire 
house to indicate that any of the occupants were <unk> nine steps above him, Roberts had <unk> Mickey paused 
with him, <unk> no longer <unk> trying now to think it out, 
do a little planning. He looked down over the <unk> at the hotel desk, 
with the telephone and pen set.   If I could call in, they 
could check the story while we were on our way. I wouldn't have to 
tell them I had <unk>   Then he heard it, like a muffled <unk> felt a subtle change in air pressure. He glanced up in time to 
see Roberts hurtling down on him from above, literally flying through 
the air, his <unk> face <unk> Mickey tried to <unk> against the <unk> gripped it with one hand, but Roberts' full weight struck 
him at that moment in the <unk> He <unk> for air and the impact <unk> 
his hand from the <unk> He tumbled with Roberts, helpless and in <unk> over and over, down the steps.   By a <unk> effort, 
he managed to hunch and draw in, to take the final fall on his back and <unk> rather than his head. He was <unk> in his mind and, for a <unk> helpless on the lobby floor, but he was <unk> and free of 
the weight of Roberts' body. When his vision cleared he saw the taller 
one <unk> <unk> <unk> Mickey was on his knees when Roberts 
turned on the stairs and the razor flashed in his hand. He felt 
his empty pocket and knew that Roberts had retrieved the only weapon 
at hand.   <unk> eyes fixed on the other's feet, which 
would first <unk> the moment and direction of an attack. He rose <unk> <unk> his knees to <unk> The <unk> pain in his <unk> nearly 
brought him down again. He made himself back off slowly, his eyes <unk> on Roberts, who now had no more to lose than <unk> The pain <unk> 
as he moved, and he <unk> inside. After a moment he extended one 
hand, the fingers <unk>   "Come on", he said. "You want 
to be that big a <unk> I was hoping for this".   Roberts <unk> at his eyes with his free hand and started down the steps. He 
held the razor well out to one side. He was <unk> to attack, 
but he could be <unk> Mickey knew, if he could be brought to make 
the first move.   They were eight feet apart when Roberts cleared 
the last step. Mickey waited with <unk> arms.   <unk> time, <unk> he said. <unk> would it be easier if I put my hands in 
my <unk>   The <unk> was lost on <unk> He advanced <unk> <unk> giving no hint of a <unk> to either side. He was 
just short of <unk> reach when he stopped. Mickey backed off two steps, <unk> him to come on again. There was a fixed grin on Roberts' <unk> made hideous by the swollen nose and the <unk> <unk> backed off again and Roberts hesitated, then came along. 
They moved in a series of rhythmic fits and <unk> a <unk> <unk> 
two steps back, two steps forward, two steps back. Mickey felt his shoulders 
come up against the wall beside the heavy slab front door. This 
was going to be it now, any second, and what he had to remember was 
to keep his eye on the <unk> no matter what, even if Roberts should <unk> with a kick to the <unk> the deadly hand was his exclusive <unk> kick came, sudden and vicious but short. <unk> <unk> twisted with the effort, but he kept his eye on the weapon. It 
moved in a silver arc toward his throat, then <unk> <unk> He <unk> 
his left shoulder into it and slashed at Roberts' <unk> with 
his own, felt the blade slide off his <unk> Before Roberts could 
move inside to cut upward toward his face, he slammed his right fist into <unk> <unk> Roberts <unk> and slashed at him wildly. <unk> <unk> <unk> and fell to one side, landing heavily on the wood 
floor. Then Roberts was on him, <unk> for breath and for a couple 
of seconds Mickey lost sight of the <unk> He felt it <unk> at the side 
of his jacket and a <unk> <unk> under his left <unk> He got a <unk> up into Roberts' <unk> used both hands and <unk> him clear, 
then scrambled to his feet. They were in the center of the lobby now. <unk> clutching the <unk> Roberts came up into a <unk> shaking 
his head. When he charged Mickey was <unk> He hit Roberts with his 
left fist in the ribs and the razor cut toward him <unk> then <unk> 
in <unk> With his right <unk> and nearly all his weight behind 
it, he smashed at the <unk> face.   Roberts <unk> <unk> 
his back <unk> fought for balance and, <unk> stumbled against 
the <unk> post at the foot of the stairs. The sound of his head striking 
the solid wood was an <unk> <unk> sound. He fell on 
his side across the lowest step, rolled over once, then lay <unk> found himself leaning against the desk, with stiff hands, <unk> for breath. After a minute he went to Roberts, looked at one 
of his eyes and felt for a <unk> He couldn't feel any. Roberts appeared 
to be <unk> if not yet, then soon, very soon. Suddenly it was 
cold in the <unk> #@ <unk> seemed to him that a long time 
had passed before he decided what to do. Actually it was no more than 
eight or ten minutes, and the sum of his reasoning came to <unk> no way to take him in now and keep those other <unk> <unk> and the one who hired the two of them- from finding out about <unk> and <unk> out. The local law here would hold me till they 
check clear back home, and maybe more than that. They would have to. 
By then they could never catch up with the others. There's no other <unk> I'll have to do it myself.   He looked at where Roberts 
lay sprawled on the step. Mickey was sure now he was <unk> thing, he thought, nobody knows about it yet. Only <unk> climbed the stairs, went into Roberts' room, found a suitcase 
and <unk> as much into it as he could. He left a few things. It didn't 
have to be <unk> Roberts was a <unk> <unk> away on <unk> 
he might logically leave behind what it was <unk> to <unk> he had closed the suitcase he found a rag and moved about 
the room, wiping carefully everything he might have <unk> It took 
him nearly an hour. He went to the room he had <unk> and got into 
his <unk> He left the rest of his things and returned to the <unk> 
He set Roberts' suitcase near the front door, went outside and 
walked back to the <unk> He was <unk> surprised to find it was <unk> 
It <unk> softly, <unk> an <unk> <unk> of his vision 
against the night sky. He could feel it on his face and in his <unk>   He found the key to the <unk> got it started and warmed 
it up for five minutes. Then he backed out and swung around to the front <unk> He went into the hotel and searched till he found the <unk> 
He put it in his own pocket for <unk> He took the suitcase 
out to the Jeep and put it in the front seat. Then he went back for <unk>   The body was heavier than he had anticipated. He 
got it onto his shoulder after some work and carried it outside and down 
to the <unk> He dumped it into the back and made sure it wouldn't <unk> out, then returned to the porch and closed the front door, making 
sure it was <unk>   He drove carefully in the direction 
of the brief tour they had taken earlier. It <unk> <unk> but <unk> <unk> When he reached the <unk> in the <unk> he saw that 
already the earlier <unk> were barely <unk> The Jeep fought its 
way through the low spot and got onto higher ground. He drove in low <unk> to the fork in the road and swung as close as possible to the entrance 
to the abandoned mine. He parked facing it and left the headlights 
on, but when he started into the tunnel with the <unk> he found 
the <unk> extended no farther than half a dozen feet into the <unk> He went back and got the <unk> returned to the tunnel 
and carried the suitcase to the edge of the pit he had found earlier. 
He tossed the bag into the pit and watched dry dust spray up around 
it. When the dust settled, he went back to the Jeep and carefully 
worked Roberts' body onto his shoulder.   It wasn't like carrying 
the <unk> The soft snow was <unk> <unk> Twice he 
nearly fell. Inside the <unk> he had to work his way over the fallen <unk> and nearly collapsed under his <unk> <unk> By the time 
he reached the edge of the pit he was panting and his shoulder and back <unk> under the drag of the dead weight.   He stood looking down 
for a few seconds, then backed up two or three paces from the edge. 
There was too much weight casually to toss it away. He could feel 
himself falling in with it and being unable to get out. It would be 
a bad place to die. It was a bad place for Roberts to wind up, but <unk> had asked for it. It was too late to worry about <unk> knelt slowly and dumped the <unk> onto the floor of the <unk> 
It was a relief to get rid of the weight. He was shaking with tension 
and it took him a couple of minutes to get his breath and settle down. 
Then he got on his knees and rolled Roberts' body toward the edge. 
It hung <unk> on the point of dropping off. He gave it a 
strong <unk> heard it <unk> then <unk> <unk> into the <unk> He got 
to his feet and threw the <unk> beam into the <unk> The body lay 
in an awkward <unk> twelve or fifteen feet below the level of the tunnel 
floor.   <unk> enough, he decided. There was little chance 
anyone would enter this shaft during the winter. The external signs of 
his approach to it would be covered by the snow, probably by the next 
day. It wasn't cold enough in the tunnel to preserve the body <unk> 
By spring it would be a <unk>   He made his way back to 
the <unk> He had started to back into the turn when he remembered 
the razor in his pocket. He climbed down, went back into the tunnel and <unk> the razor into the <unk> It landed on Roberts' sprawled right <unk> poised <unk> then slid off to the ground. He went 
back once more to the Jeep and started the short drive to the <unk> the garage he checked the Jeep for signs of the use he had 
made of it. There were <unk> here and there and he cleaned them off, 
using an <unk> rag he found on a <unk> He wiped the steering wheel 
and all the places he might have touched the <unk> He replaced the <unk> where it had been <unk> got into his own car and backed it 
out of the <unk> There were tire marks where it had been, but they 
were <unk> by others and on the dusty floor would not be noticeable 
except under close scrutiny. <unk> <unk> he thought, might spend 
some time <unk> for her lost <unk> but he doubted that she would <unk> an investigation. He judged her to be a woman of some pride, 
though not much sense. Still she would probably have sense enough not 
to call in the local sheriff to find her boy friend who, apparently, 
had run <unk> put in a call to <unk> from his hotel room. The maid 
answered and he decided <unk> must be at work.   <unk> cautioned 
him not to be too hopeful and then, <unk> his own advice, said <unk> 
"But it does sound good. A woman named <unk> who tells nobody 
anything about herself. That courtyard picture with the same <unk> not exactly jumping up and down with <unk> 
I'll call you in a day or so".   On the highway he relaxed 
and enjoyed the drive over Lake <unk> and along the <unk> <unk> was ten miles <unk> more of a quaint old <unk> town than those along the beach made <unk> by tourist <unk> checked into a motel and drove downtown. The <unk> 
was a <unk> building minus the customary <unk> Instead of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> of bare dirt in most small-town <unk> the building was <unk> in by a <unk> growth of <unk> and <unk> and a smooth lawn the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> grass.   He figured his best bet was a call 
on the <unk> A clerk in the outer office took him in to <unk> <unk> a big, <unk> man with thick, white hair and a voice with 
a <unk> resonance which suggested he should be running for higher <unk>   <unk> in front of the desk, Hank said, "I'm 
looking for some information with very little to go on, <unk> explained the background of the case, ending with the tenuous <unk> which had brought him to Gulf <unk>   The <unk> <unk> chair tilted back. "So you're looking for a woman who married 
a man who might have lived here a year ago and might have been <unk> 
If there was such a person, I'm afraid she got away with 
it. <unk> we don't know more about him. I think the best bet is to 
go through the society columns of last year and see if any of the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> a little later. It'll be a <unk> job, 
but if you want to try it, the old newspaper <unk> are in the basement 
here in the county <unk> <unk>   "Maybe the society 
editor would remember a <unk> out-of-town <unk> an idea. Mrs& Calhoun has been society editor here 
for twenty-five years. The editor says that marriages may be made in <unk> but <unk> are made in Mrs& <unk> columns. She's 
the one who decides which wedding is to get the lead space in the Sunday 
paper and all that". He smiled. <unk> when the editor was 
just out of the hospital from a <unk> operation, Mrs& Calhoun 
and the mother of the bride went out to his house and fought it out 
beside his bed. She'd be sure to remember any bride who was vague about <unk> She'd have made a great scientist dedicated to <unk> 
down <unk> and environment. She'd also remember if the <unk> 
died later". He stood up. "I wish you good luck, but please don't <unk> up too tough a case for me this close to election. If you 
find out anything, come on back here and we'll get started on <unk> down Mrs& Calhoun was like trying to catch up with <unk> <unk> between <unk> and <unk> It turned out that 
she also sold real <unk> <unk> and hospital <unk> The <unk> <unk> stretched into the <unk> from newspaper plant to insurance 
office to her house and back to the newspaper, where he found 
her at five o'clock.   She was a large woman with a <unk> gray <unk> cut and a pencil clamped like a bit between her teeth while 
she hunted and <unk> on an old <unk> It took a couple of minutes 
to run through her various <unk> and get down to the one he <unk> <unk> Well, I do remember one. From <unk> <unk> <unk> a man named Vincent <unk> I remember her because 
she didn't want her picture in the paper. First bride like that I've 
seen in twenty-five years".   "What reason did she <unk> she had a <unk> on her <unk> some sort 
of <unk> and none of her old pictures was good enough. I didn't 
see her till several days later at the <unk> and her face looked 
like it had never had a <unk> on it. But, of course, you couldn't 
see too well through the <unk>   <unk> her name <unk> <unk> how in hell would I remember <unk> mind. I can look it up. Do they still live <unk> think they moved away shortly after they were married. He 
was a salesman for something or other and must have been <unk> 
I'm sure it'll be in the <unk> We usually run a social note when 
somebody moves <unk>   He stood up and <unk> her.   "Have 
they inherited some money or <unk> she asked with a <unk> <unk> in her eye.   He said <unk> "Well, it is 
a little legal matter, but nothing like that".   He hurried across 
to the <unk> and caught the sheriff just as he was <unk> like what you're <unk> he said when Hank had <unk> "Come on, let's hurry down before they lock up for the <unk>   In the basement the sheriff took him to a small, <unk> 
office occupied by a tall, thin man informal in <unk> shirt <unk> <unk> **h <unk> <unk> chairman of the board

door. It won't open from inside. Before we built the new <unk> 
we used to keep prisoners in here overnight sometimes when the old jail 
got too <unk> <unk> treats himself a lot better than we do <unk> 
They were a sight more comfortable than the ones in the jail with 
the cold air from <unk> air conditioner coming through the <unk> walked past the sheriff into a <unk> room with <unk> full of big, <unk> volumes from floor to ceiling all 
around the walls. A metal table and four chairs stood in the <unk> all here, back to <unk> <unk> told him. 
"It's all right to smoke, but make sure your cigarettes are out 
before you leave. And, of course, you know not to take <unk> leave the air conditioner on for you, Mr& <unk> 
said <unk> "Don't forget to turn it off and close the door 
good so it'll <unk>   Hank <unk> them and promised to <unk> the rules. When they had gone, he stood for a minute breathing 
in the <unk> of old paper and leather which the busily <unk> 
air conditioner couldn't quite <unk> 

#CHAPTER <unk> 
a tour around the <unk> he found that the earliest volumes began on 
the left and progressed <unk> around the room. An old weakness for <unk> in records rose up to <unk> him.   It was, indeed, 
all <unk> almost a century. From reconstruction to moon <unk> But 
he pulled away from the irrelevant old volumes and walked around to 
the newer ones.   Last year's volume was at the top a couple 
of inches below the ceiling. Near it was a metal ladder on <unk> attached 
to the top <unk> He pulled it over, climbed up, and lifted out 
the big volume, almost losing his balance from the weight of it. He <unk> over and dropped it on the table.   Since Mrs& Calhoun 
remembered only that the marriage had been in the spring, he started 
to <unk> through several months. He tried to turn right to the society <unk> in each one, but interesting stories kept <unk> up to <unk> 
him. At last he found it in the paper of April 2.   It 
told him little more than Mrs& Calhoun had remembered, stating that 
it had been a small, modest wedding compared to some of the <unk> was a marked contrast in the amount of information on bride 
and <unk> Mr& Black's life was an open book, so to speak, from 
his birth in Jackson, Mississippi, through his <unk> 
days at <unk> and his attainment of a <unk> degree, which 
had presumably prepared him for his career as district sales manager 
for <unk> Business <unk>   The one line on the bride 
said she was Miss <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> No mention of 
New Orleans.   Hank was beginning to feel sharp concern for 
Mr& <unk> If Mrs& Black was who he thought she was, Mr& Black's <unk> selling days might well be over.   Now for their <unk> from Gulf <unk> This time the search took twice as long, <unk> down on his extra reading, for he had to pick through several <unk> of one- and <unk> social notes in each issue. He found 
it in the edition of May <unk> The item said Mr& and Mrs& Black 
had moved to Jackson, his home <unk> so the lovely <unk> had been 
with him a year ago.   Next on his program was a call to the Jackson 
office of <unk> Business <unk> to find out if Vincent <unk> was still with them- or, more <unk> still with <unk> glanced at his watch, saw it was only <unk> and decided 
to indulge his weakness now. For the next hour he scrambled happily 
up and down the <unk> sharing the excitement of reporters who had seen <unk> <unk> the <unk> Theater fire in Chicago, 
and the <unk> trial.   In the middle of the stock market <unk> he heard a slight noise in the outer office. He turned around, 
saw nothing, and decided it must be a <unk> Something else distracted 
him, yet there was no sound, only <unk> silence. Then he knew 
it was not sound, but lack of it. The air conditioner was no longer <unk>   He jumped up and turned around to see the metal door <unk> It <unk> shut as he sprang toward it.   He pressed 
his face against the <unk> "Who's there"?   The light <unk> through the <unk> dimly <unk> the office <unk> enough 
for him to see there was no one there. Then he heard the outer door <unk>   "Hey, come <unk> he shouted. He thought it must 
be some damn <unk> or cleaning woman <unk> around, figuring 
that <unk> had gone off and forgotten to turn off everything and lock 
up. <unk> the faint beginnings of fear stirred in his mind. Unless 
he was <unk> the person who'd just left couldn't have missed 
seeing Hank through the open door of the <unk> lighted room. And 
even if he'd somehow missed seeing him, he wouldn't have gone off 
and left the light on and door open in the file room.   <unk> 
it was had meant to shut him up in here, had followed him and waited 
till the <unk> and square were deserted. But <unk> To search 
his room at the <unk> To come back later and kill him after the stores 
had closed around the square and everybody had <unk> No, they 
could <unk> him just as easy right now. Nobody could hear what was going 
on in this underground <unk>   Then he heard it and smelled it- 
the steady <unk> the <unk> familiar <unk> of gas <unk> 
It must be coming from an upright heater against the far wall in the <unk> office.   Until now, <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
had been like an <unk> which he could <unk> at his own pace 
and <unk>   Except for those minutes in her room, he had 
lost touch with her as a reality. <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> had <unk> him into thinking 
of <unk> and <unk> separately or together, as a <unk> They kept drifting <unk> and <unk> again in his mind like some minute form of life 
on a microscope <unk> said Mr& <unk> "I take a little time to 
think it over". It was <unk> very <unk> There would be all 
the <unk> of <unk> someone else to take over. Someone reasonably <unk> And Angie would hear about it. And Angie <unk> said <unk> and he smiled very sweet and slow at 
Mr& <unk> "Not too much time, because I'll be <unk> some 
more myself pretty much right away. And I done favors for you, big 
favor not so long back, didn't I, and I'm right here to take on 
where <unk> left off. No trouble. I don't want no trouble, you 
don't want no trouble, nobody wants trouble, Mr& <unk> <unk> no, thought Mr& <unk> turning away as another 
man came in. He straightened his tie at the mirror with a shaking <unk> 
the genial smile seemed painted on his face. Angie <unk> <unk> 
of dangerous <unk> Angie knew too much entirely already. <unk> 
he had Mr& Skyros at bay **h   <unk> favor I done 
you. <unk> there's this deal o' <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> fire, ain't it, maybe you've been <unk> <unk> 
over that. And can't say I blame you", said Angie <unk> 
"This deal with the ace o' <unk> Anything to do with an ace <unk> <unk> bad <unk>   <unk> of <unk> a widow, that was 
what they called a widow, these <unk> <unk> remembered Mr& Skyros <unk> All about that Angie knew, too. When things got 
a little out of hand, they very rapidly got a lot out of <unk> it seemed 
to be a general rule. All just by <unk> and in a way tracing 
back to poor <unk> all of it, because <unk> brothers, living <unk> and <unk>   Mr& Skyros did not at all like the 
look on <unk> <unk> almost <unk> <unk> <unk> 
or indeed anything about <unk> Mr& Skyros was not a man 
who thought very much about moral <unk> he found money much more <unk> but all the same he thought now, <unk> of the way 
in which Angelo earned his <unk> and paid for his own <unk> 
and eyed the soft smile, and the <unk> dark eyes, and he felt a 
little <unk>   <unk> my <unk> he said, "in my life I <unk> how is it the <unk> says, better an <unk> of prevention to a <unk> of <unk> I stay in business so long because I'm <unk> Two <unk> a month, we talk it over again, and maybe if nothing happens <unk> to say the cops know this and that, then we make a little <unk> 
isn't it"?   "That's a long <unk> said <unk> 
"I tell you, you want to leave it that way, I don't fool around 
with it. I go over to Castro and get fixed up there. I can't wait 
no two <unk>   And Mr& Skyros didn't like <unk> but 
what with <unk> and three of his boys inside, and not likely 
to come out- And Angie such a valuable <unk> <unk> <unk> 
All the <unk> and danger of getting in touch with practically a 
whole new bunch of <unk> Why did everything have to happen at <unk> said <unk> "Why, you ain't turning Angie down, 
are you, Mr& <unk> I mean, we all <unk> I guess <unk> <unk> <unk>   Angelo gave him an <unk> <unk> "Mr& Skyros too smart a fellow want to get rid of me", 
he said. "It's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>

and over, anybody to <unk> Not being a <unk> Mr& Skyros knew <unk> But aside from everything else, it would scarcely be pleasant 
to have dealings with one who was <unk> an <unk> and actually <unk> you could <unk> the whip hand. And all because of <unk>

The sweat broke out on Mr& <unk> forehead as he realized he had 
been actually <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>   Good 
God above, had not <unk> been <unk>   He patted <unk> <unk> shoulder <unk> "Now you don't want to go talking

opened it an inch and <unk> out the keys for me to give you. <unk> 
She thrust a bundle of keys <unk> on a thick red <unk> into <unk> <unk> "Not that there's much use in locking up the <unk> 
and the <unk> now. <unk> your <unk>   <unk> <unk> <unk> Maude suddenly looked quite capable of pouring 
it down her throat. "I don't want it", Sarah said, <unk> <unk> I'll take it down with me as I go". <unk> <unk> up the cup and <unk> up her top <unk> as if about to take 
off with a racing start. At the door she turned back, her Roman nose 
looking very long now and <unk> "I <unk> Ben and Lucien 
have gone after them. It's just like that book your Northern friend <unk> except there aren't any ice <unk> to cross and no <unk> don't know Mrs& <unk> **h. What can they 
do if they find <unk>   "They can't do anything. It's <unk> <unk> running after them like that. I told Ben so. But 
of course the <unk> won't be of any help, not with everything 
so upset and that Yankee cavalry outfit they say is running around, 
God knows <unk>   She had <unk> away, she had been gone for 
a long time probably when Sarah suddenly realized that she ought to 
stop her, pour out the coffee, so no one would drink it. But then the <unk> coffee was bad enough at best, cold it was all but <unk> 
especially that <unk>   She was <unk> <unk> sure 
that Lucien had filled it with <unk> She had <unk> with <unk> 
she had resisted his demands for <unk> and if she died, by the provisions 
of her marriage contract, Lucien would <unk> <unk> not 
only the immediate sum of gold under the <unk> in the office, but <unk> when the war was over, her father's entire <unk>   She 
felt cold and hot, sticky and <unk> at the same time. Now wait a <unk> she told herself, think about it; Lucien is not the only person 
in this house who could have put opium in that coffee.   She 
had lost a bottle of <unk> but that was on the trip from New Orleans. 
Or someone had taken it during her first day at <unk> Yes, 
she had missed it after her talk with <unk> after dinner, just 
before <unk> was shot. <unk> or Glendora had entered her room while 
she <unk> bringing back her washed clothes. So somebody else could 
have come in, too- then or later while she was out of the room. It 
would have been easy to identify as opium by its <unk>   It was 
not very reasonable to believe that Lucien had <unk> <unk> <unk> and come back to <unk> with a formed plan to murder her. He 
didn't even know that she was there. And he certainly couldn't 
have guessed that she would resist his demand for the gold or that she 
was not the <unk> yes, and <unk> fool he had every right to <unk> No, he had been surprised, <unk> surprised, but <unk> somebody <unk> Don't question, Rev had said, don't <unk> danger. Her skin <unk> <unk> had told Maude that 
she was in the hall and the door was open. Sarah had begun to tell <unk> of <unk> she had begun to question and a little draft had crept 
across the room from the bedroom door, open barely enough to show 
a <unk> of <unk> in the hall. So <unk> or <unk> could have <unk> and that somebody could have already been supplied with 
the missing bottle of <unk>   That was not reasonable either. 
The opium had disappeared before <unk> death and <unk> shot him 
could not by any stretch of the imagination have foreseen <unk> 
own doubts and <unk> and questions.   She began to doubt 
whether there had been in fact a <unk> dose of opium in the <unk> So <unk> somebody only wished to frighten her, so she would leave <unk> made a certain amount of <unk> <unk> to the <unk> was the fact that while she might have tasted the coffee if it 
had been still hot, she might even have drunk some of it, she wouldn't 
have taken enough to kill her, for she would have been warned by 
its taste.   No. It was merely an attempt to frighten <unk> wouldn't go back to New York as Maude <unk> she wouldn't 
run like a scared <unk> <unk> well, she'd be very <unk> dressed and the accustomed routine restored to her a sense 
of normal everyday life.   But before she left her room she dug 
into her big <unk> bag, took out the envelope holding her marriage contract 
and the wax seal had been <unk> So somebody else knew what 
would happen to her father's money if she died.   Rev had known 
all along. Rev didn't need to break the wax <unk> read the contract 
and find out. He could conceivably have wished to make <unk> Rev <unk> <unk> it was like a part of his breath and body; Rev 
had stressed the need for money. Rev would never have tried to give her <unk>   She thrust the envelope back in the <unk> there 
was no point in locking it up in the <unk> now, it was like locking 
the barn after the horse was <unk> And in all <unk> by now, 
there was more than one person in the house who knew the terms of her 
marriage contract. There was no point either in telling herself again 
what a fool she'd been.   She went downstairs and received another <unk> shock, for when Glendora <unk> into the dining room in 
her <unk> <unk> Sarah asked her when she had brought coffee 
to her room and Glendora said she <unk> <unk> much work this morning, 
Miss <unk> everybody gone like <unk>   Sarah swallowed 
past another kind of <unk> in her throat. "Well, then 
who brought it"?   "Miss <unk> She come to the kitchen 
and say she take it up to you". Glendora put down a dish of <unk> <unk> "Not much breakfast this morning. I don't know what we're 
going to do, Miss <unk>   "We've got to <unk> <unk> said, <unk> because a chill crawled over her again. <unk> <unk> away. The rice wasn't <unk> with <unk> 
indeed it had no taste at all, not a grain of <unk> She ate what she 
could and went out along the covered <unk> with the rain dripping 
from the <unk> In the kitchen Glendora was <unk> picking <unk> "Get a <unk> Sarah told her. "We'll go to the <unk>   Glendora dropped a chicken and a <unk> of <unk> 
and went with her through the <unk> to the <unk> Sarah 
found the right key and unlocked the door.   It was a long, 
low room, like a root <unk> for it was <unk> up with <unk> and vines 
had run <unk> over that, too. It was dark but dry and cool. She <unk> out what Glendora vaguely guessed were the right amounts of dried <unk> eggs, <unk> a little <unk> The shelves looked <unk> than 
when Miss <unk> had shown her the <unk> and since the men from 
the <unk> had <unk> there were certainly now fewer mouths 
to feed but there was less to feed them with. She took Glendora to 
the <unk> unlocked it and saw with satisfaction there was still 
a quantity of <unk> and sides of <unk> hanging from the <unk> <unk>   They wouldn't go <unk> not yet. And the fields 
were green and growing. "Can't you possibly imagine what life is 
going to be like, here"? Maude had said.   <unk> 
She 
sent Glendora back to the house, her basket and her <unk> <unk> She 
stood for a moment, rain dripping from the trees over her head, thinking 
of <unk>   Maude had the opportunity to take the bottle 
of opium from <unk> room. Maude had the cool <unk> to <unk> <unk> 
whatever she made up her mind to do. She couldn't see how her death 
could affect <unk> She couldn't see any reason why Maude would 
attempt to frighten her. Besides, there was something <unk> and <unk> something almost childish about an attempt to frighten her. Maude 
was neither <unk> nor silly and Sarah rather doubted if she 
had ever 
been <unk>   Yet Maude had suggested that Sarah return to 
New York. Maude could have shot <unk> if she'd had a reason 
to kill him.   There was no use in standing there in the <unk> 
trying to find a link between <unk> murder and opium in a cup 
of coffee.   She started back for the house, saw a light in the <unk> opened the door and surprised a domestic little scene which was 
far outside the dark realm of murder or attempted murder. <unk> George 
and <unk> were <unk> shoes.   a lighted lamp stood on the 
table that <unk> <unk> day. They were all three bent over a <unk> <unk> <unk> George had a <unk> <unk> <unk> held a patch of <unk> Rev <unk> something, a tiny <unk> waiting for <unk> <unk> <unk> George said, <unk> thing I do when I get to <unk> 
again, is get me a <unk>   "With boots on", <unk> laughed softly.   Rev looked up and saw her. <unk> 
looked up and <unk> George didn't look up at all. There was 
no way to know, no way to guess whether any one of them was surprised 
at <unk> appearance, believing her to be <unk> and <unk> 
and just possibly dead.   Rev said, "Come in, <unk> <unk> 
you know the <unk>   And what news, Sarah thought as <unk> 
as Maude might have said it.   <unk> face was suddenly 
a little fixed and <unk> He turned to George and <unk> "Take 
your <unk> shop somewhere else. I want to talk to <unk> in the office, the spreading circle of <unk> 
the patch of leather in <unk> hands. George poised with the <unk> <unk> the <unk> everyday atmosphere, all denied an attempt 
at murder. A rush of panic caught <unk> "No. Not now. I mean 
I've got to- to see to the kitchen. <unk>   Her words <unk> together and she all but ran from the office and from the 
question in <unk> face.   Now why did I do that? she thought 
as warm, <unk> rain touched her face. She was no <unk> <unk> to bear <unk>   As she reached the kitchen door the answer 
presented itself; if she told anyone of the opium it must be <unk> 
her husband.   It might be, indeed it had already proved 
to be a marriage without love, but it was marriage. So she couldn't <unk> Rev as a <unk> it must be <unk>   <unk> provided 
that Lucien himself had not <unk> her coffee with <unk> she thought, 
as <unk> and <unk> again, as Maude might have said <unk> paused at the kitchen door, caught her breath, told herself firmly 
that the opium was only an attempt to frighten her and went into 
the kitchen, where Glendora was <unk> the chickens <unk> and Maude 
was cleaning lamp <unk> Glendora gave a <unk> "Miss <unk> 
I can't cut up no <unk> Miss Maude say she <unk> <unk> the <unk> everyday details of daily living <unk> a vicious 
attempt to frighten her- or to murder her.   The homely everyday 
details of living and domestic requirements also pressed upon her 
with their immediate <unk> No matter what had happened or hadn't <unk> 
somebody had to see about dinner. She eyed the chickens with, if she 
had known it, something of <unk> dismal look and thought with 
a certain fury of the time she had spent on Latin <unk> since last night. I didn't think there was any reason <unk>   "Maybe there <unk> <unk> to him again anyway. Try 
talking to some of the <unk> he works with, friends, anyone. Try 
to find out how happy he is with his wife, whether he plays around with <unk> You might try looking into his wife too. She might have been 
talking to some of her friends about her husband if they've been 
having any trouble".   "You think Black's the one we're 
looking <unk>   <unk> I think he might <unk> Conrad 
said <unk> "Then again he might not".   "What a <unk> <unk> Rourke said. <unk> is <unk> best <unk> know".   "Will you be coming back <unk> think so. I'm on my way to see the <unk> <unk> <unk> What <unk> You don't think Gilborn 
is <unk>   "I don't think anything. I just don't 
want to go off <unk> before picking up Black, that's all". <unk> <unk> <unk> says he was in his office all day with 
her yesterday. I'd like to make sure. Also, it's just possible 
she might know something about Mrs& <unk>   <unk> 
I'll see you later".   <unk> you ever going to go <unk> sure as hell doesn't look like it, does it? 
I'm telling you, if these <unk> ever knew the trouble they put us 
to, they'd think twice before letting themselves get knocked <unk> to tell that to the next <unk> you <unk> hung up and sat on the small <unk> <unk> <unk> 
his right leg.   He looked at his watch. It was ten minutes 
before <unk>   He wondered how long it would be before they 
had a signed confession from <unk> <unk>   <unk> years' experience 
let him know, even at this early stage, that Black was his 
man.   But he still wanted to know why. <unk> was a cold, <unk> 
day, the day after <unk> death, but Stanley Gilborn paid no 
attention to the <unk> October wind.   After leaving <unk> <unk> had no <unk> He simply walked, not <unk> where 
he was, not <unk> He stopped automatically at the street <unk> 
waiting for the traffic lights to change, <unk> of other people, his <unk> open and <unk>   As he walked, he tried to <unk> <unk> Of himself. <unk> of what Conrad had tried to make 
him believe.   There was nothing <unk> about his thinking. 
It was a succession of <unk> passing through his <unk> the 
same ones, different ones, in no apparent <unk> in no logical <unk> <unk> of what Conrad had told him made it impossible 
for Gilborn to <unk> with any degree of <unk> the <unk> 
of it.   <unk> words had intellectual meaning for him only. <unk> they penetrated him not at all.   <unk> he 
was and your wife were <unk>   Gilborn remembered <unk> 
exact words. They made sense and yet they didn't. He knew Conrad 
had told him the truth. It was so. Yet it wasn't so. It wasn't 
so because it couldn't be so.   When Kitti was <unk> 
and he remembered the pressure of her hand resting lightly on his <unk> 
she had been the center of his life.   She was the sun, he the <unk> planet <unk> around her, the rest of the world existing 
and visible yet removed.   For <unk> years he had <unk> <unk> 
towards a <unk> <unk> working, breathing without plan, 
without reason.   Kitti had come along to justify everything. She 
was his goal, she was his reason. He had lived all his life waiting 
for her.   Not once, in the time that he had known her, had he 
ever considered the <unk> not once, not for one <unk> 
of a second, of her <unk>   He could not consider it now. 
Not <unk> And so he walked, <unk> again.   The walk ended, <unk> right in front of his hotel building. The <unk> began 
to nod his head <unk> then remembered who Gilborn was, what 
had happened to him the night before. He looked at Gilborn with <unk> <unk>   Gilborn passed by him without seeing <unk> crossed the lobby and rode up in the elevator lost in his own <unk>   In the apartment itself, all was still. The police 
were no longer there. There was no evidence that anything was different 
than it had been.   Except that Kitti wasn't <unk> taking off his coat, he sat in the blue chair which still <unk> the closed bedroom door.   At last, sitting there, in the 
familiar <unk> the truth began to sink in.   <unk> felt no anger towards <unk> no sense that she had betrayed 
him.   <unk>   She was all he had, everything he had, 
everything he <unk> Someone had taken her away from him. <unk>   Where there is a <unk> entry in the <unk> there 
is a right-hand one, he remembered from his school days.   Where 
there is a <unk> there is a <unk>   <unk> <unk> he was and your wife were <unk>   He rose from 
the <unk> took off his coat. <unk> he went into the <unk> bed still showed signs of where Kitti had <unk> Gilborn stood 
there for a long time. He looked at the bed <unk>   The 
bed was empty now. Kitti would lie in it no more. He would lie in 
it no more.   Gilborn wondered whether Kitti had <unk> in that 
same bed with **h <unk>   For thirty minutes, Stanley Gilborn 
stood there.   At the end of the <unk> <unk> his <unk> <unk> over and over again of <unk> her friends, her past, he 
left the bedroom.   <unk>   He could think of no <unk> put on his coat again. Before <unk> he took one <unk> <unk> look at the apartment.   He knew he would never 
see it again.   In the street, walking as quickly as he could, Stanley <unk> was a lone figure. <unk> Blanche <unk> Kitti <unk> death had a quite different effect. For <unk> <unk> 
death was a source of <unk> but <unk> <unk> happy <unk> <unk> defense, it must be said she was unaware of 
the newborn hope.   If anyone had asked her, she would have described <unk> only as nervous and <unk> The figures on the <unk> 
paper in front of her were jumping and waving around so badly it 
was all she could do to make them out clearly enough to copy them with 
the <unk>   She wondered whether Stanley would <unk> She 
wanted to be with him, to give him the comfort and <unk> she 
knew he needed.   She had skipped her lunch hour in the fear that 
he might call while she was out. He <unk> And now she was feeling <unk> both from concern about Stanley and <unk>   Why hadn't 
he <unk>   <unk> she <unk> even men like <unk> 
are <unk>   She tried to think of his <unk> <unk> in the eleven years she had known him and discovered they weren't 
so many after all.   Stanley really was quite <unk> 
That was one of the things she liked about <unk> He wasn't like 
so many other men. The dentist last night, for <unk> <unk> and 
the movies had been fine. He had taken her upstairs to say good night. 
She had invited him in for coffee.   It was in the kitchen, 
as she was watching the <unk> waiting for the water to <unk> that 
he had grabbed for her. Without warning, without giving her a chance 
to prepare for it. From <unk> he had put his arms on her shoulders, 
turned her around, and pressed her to him, so close she couldn't <unk> she <unk> for the long scratch across his face, 
tried to explain she couldn't help herself, that the panic arose 
in her <unk> But he hadn't understood. When he left, she knew 
she would never see him again.   Stanley wasn't like that. She 
could always predict what Stanley was going to do, ever since she 
first met him.   Except for that one morning. The morning he walked 
in to announce to her, <unk> that he was married. She thought 
she was going to die.   She had assumed before then that one 
day he would ask her to marry him.   Blanche couldn't remember 
when she had first arrived at this conclusion. She thought it was <unk> during the second week she worked for <unk> It was nothing 
that he said or did, but it seemed so <unk> to her that she 
should be working for him, looking forward to his eventual <unk> was <unk> years old then. Her mother was already considerably 
concerned over her <unk> future. But Blanche had been 
able to maintain a <unk> and assured <unk> in the face of her <unk> <unk> continued <unk> had been able to resist her <unk> 
to date anyone who offered the slightest possibility of <unk> <unk> it was only a matter of time before Stanley would <unk> It was to be expected that Stanley would be <unk> slow in 
taking such a momentous step. Stanley went along in life, she knew, <unk> that he deserved the love and faith of no woman. As a result, 
he never looked for it.   But one day, she expected, he would <unk> <unk> without her having to tell him, that there was such 
a woman in the world; a woman who was willing to give him love, faith, 
and anything else a woman could give a husband. Indeed, there was 
a woman who, <unk> had already given him love. <unk> Blanche <unk> <unk>   And then, <unk> Stanley made his <unk>   On that first day, Blanche literally thought 
she was going to die, or, at the very least, go out of her <unk> might have been easier for her if Kitti Walker hadn't been 
everything that Blanche was not.   Kitti was thirty years younger 
than <unk> taller than <unk> <unk> than Stanley had any 
right to hope for, much less <unk> Kitti could have married a score 
of men. There was no reason for her to marry someone like Stanley <unk> there was no <unk> for her to marry <unk>   Kitti 
had come into the office, on somebody's <unk> because she 
needed help in preparing her income tax return.   Stanley had 
filled out the return and because, when he was finished, it was close 
to the lunch hour, he had <unk> asked Kitti to join him, never expecting 
her to <unk>   Blanche knew all this because the door 
to <unk> office was open and, without straining too hard, she could 
hear everything that was said.   Stanley had gone out, saying 
he would be back in an hour. He hadn't come back for over <unk> that day, Blanche still didn't know exactly what had happened. 
There were mornings when Stanley came in late, afternoons when 
he left early, days when he didn't come in at all.   Blanche 
knew something must be causing <unk> new, strange behavior but 
she never once connected it with Kitti <unk> It was too <unk> <unk> six weeks after the day Kitti first came into the office, <unk> announced he and Kitti were married.   <unk> Blanche 
managed to cover the stunned surprise and offer her <unk> night the two of them left for a week's honeymoon 
in <unk>   While they were away Blanche came into the office 
every morning, running things as she had always run them for <unk> 
going through the week in a <unk> <unk> getting things done <unk> 
out of <unk>   For exactly one week, she was able to <unk> in this manner.   On the morning of <unk> return, 
however, her strength left her. Two hours of watching his <unk> 
happy face, listening to his soft humming as he bent over his <unk> <unk> and Blanche had to leave.   She stayed away for ten 
days. Those ten days were like no others that Blanche had <unk> she stayed in bed. She didn't tell anyone, even her <unk> what was wrong. She refused to have a doctor, insisting there 
was nothing a doctor could do for <unk> said the fingerprint man. <unk> if you're going 
to believe those <unk> you'll have to look for a killer who's 
a <unk> piano <unk>   He demonstrated by playing an <unk> <unk> doing a <unk> passage with a <unk> exaggerated attack. 
To make it clearer he shifted to acting out, but with no change 
of manner, the killing of Rose <unk> His hands snatched at an <unk> <unk> <unk> down hard to grab it and coming away with equal <unk> like a ball that's been bounced hard. In the same way he <unk> <unk> a <unk> and bouncing <unk> off that, pressing his 
hands against the floor and bouncing <unk> off that. He was moving 
like a ballet <unk> playing for <unk> If Rose <unk> killer <unk> this way, catching up with him was going to be a <unk> We'd 
know him by his stretch <unk> and the flowers he'd wear <unk> 
in his hair.   Perhaps if Felix had first come upon us when this 
boy was not <unk> so <unk> up and down the hall outside the murdered <unk> apartment, we might have had less trouble convincing Felix 
of our <unk> This, you will remember, was still New Year's <unk> By the time Felix turned up it was early afternoon, which, one 
would think, would be late enough so that by then, except for small children 
and a few hardy souls who had not yet <unk> up, it could have 
been expected that people would no longer be having any sort of active 
interest in the previous night's <unk> and paper <unk> was the <unk> He had retained his hat and his <unk> 
and, 
whatever fun might still be going, he was ready to join it. That, <unk> 
might give you some idea of what Felix was like. After 
all, he hadn't happened upon us in that <unk> hall without <unk> <unk> boys had finished their <unk> examination 
and the body had been removed for <unk> The meat wagon, therefore, 
was not out in front of the house any more, but the cluster 
of squad cars was still there and there was a cop on the door downstairs 
to screen any <unk> and <unk> There was, <unk> the <unk> of curious <unk> gathered in the street and a couple more cops 
to hold them at a decent distance.   Just put yourself in <unk> 
place for a moment. You're a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> been away from home for the New <unk> <unk> but now 
the party is over and you come home. <unk> <unk> in the limited 
sense of being free from the clinical symptoms of the effects of alcohol <unk> and not yet eliminated from the system, you are <unk> still have your paper hat and you're wearing it, but then, 
it is an extraordinary paper hat and, in addition to anything else 
you may be, you are also the sculptor who created that most peculiar <unk> 
out in the back <unk> It's not too much to assume that you will 
have a more lasting interest in paper hats than will Mr& <unk> <unk>   You have your paper horn clutched in your big, <unk> <unk> and for your entrance you have planned a <unk> colorful and <unk> <unk> to your friends and <unk> You find your house a <unk> of public and police attention. Can you imagine yourself forgetting 
under the circumstances that you are approaching this startling and <unk> situation so <unk> <unk> and armed with a paper <unk> one could be startled into <unk> You shoulder 
your way through the cluster of the curious and you barge up to 
the <unk> on the door. You identify yourself and ask him what's going 
on. Instead of answering you, he sticks his head in the door and <unk> 
up the stairs.   <unk> the upstairs <unk> he <unk> "The <unk> Do I send him <unk> Then he turns back to you. "Go 
on <unk> he says. <unk> tell you what's <unk> 
Even then, as you go into the house <unk> by the knowledge that 
something is cooking and that your house has passed under this <unk> 
official control, could you go on forgetting that you still had 
that ridiculous hat on your head and you were still carrying that childish <unk> in your <unk>   What I'm getting at is that we 
were fully prepared for <unk> being an odd one. We'd seen his <unk> out in the back yard, and the little his <unk> had told us 
of him did make him sound a little special. We were not, however, prepared 
for anything like the <unk> that confronted us as Felix came 
up the stairs. He, of course, must have been equally unprepared for 
what confronted him, but, <unk> I did find his reaction <unk> Felix was still wearing the hat and carrying the horn 
because he'd forgotten about them, he now <unk> He came <unk> 
up the stairs and joined the dance. He adjusted the hat, lifted 
the horn to his lips as though it were a <unk> and fell in alongside 
our fingerprint expert to <unk> with him.   Our man stopped 
dead and <unk> at <unk> Felix threw his head back and laughed a <unk> that shook the <unk> of even that solidly built old house. This 
was a bull of a man. He was <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
His face was <unk> and heavy and <unk> and when he laughed 
he showed his teeth, which were big and white and strong and unquestionably <unk> I don't remember ever seeing teeth that were quite 
so white and at the same time quite so <unk> not <unk> His <unk> had <unk> most of the way to the back of his neck. He had only 
a fringe of hair and he wore it <unk> short. It was almost as white 
as his teeth. For a man of his mass he was curiously short. He 
wasn't a <unk> but he was a bit of a comic figure. A man with so big 
and so <unk> developed a <unk> and such long and powerful arms 
is expected to stand taller than five feet <unk> For Felix it was 
a bit of a stretch to make even that <unk> The man was just this 
side of being a <unk>   We waited till he had finished laughing, 
and that gave us a few moments for taking stock of him. He was dressed 
in a manner <unk> might suggest for the outdoor man's 
country <unk> Dark gray sports <unk> lighter gray <unk> pink <unk> <unk> black silk <unk> His eyes were clear. He was <unk> <unk> and if there had been any alcohol in him we could never have <unk> <unk> some <unk> of it on the massive <unk> of his laughter. 
Not even a <unk> Eventually he <unk>   <unk> <unk> said.   <unk> he said <unk> <unk> the happy <unk> much Latin we <unk> <unk> said <unk> "You

nothing was more obvious than the joy he took in <unk> how <unk> 
he was and how full of juice and spirit. We followed him up the <unk> The cops would gather up <unk> and the <unk> on the third 
floor and bring us those of them who would <unk> submit to <unk> may think we didn't need <unk> and <unk> 
but you always get what you can when you can, and we had no guarantee 
that a fingerprint record on them couldn't be useful before we were 
through with this case. Also, if we had excluded the ladies we would 
have to that extent let the whole world know at least that much of where 
we <unk> The <unk> if in our present group, would certainly be 
interested in knowing that much, and even though with the fingerprint 
evidence what it was I could see no way he could use this bit of information 
to improve on his situation, there might always be some way. If 
you can possibly avoid it, you don't hand out any extra <unk> took us into his <unk> It was that <unk> shaped space 
at the very top of the house, where ceiling <unk> had to accommodate 
themselves to the varying angles of roof <unk> At each angle of its <unk> a big <unk> had been fitted into the roof and all these <unk> 
were fitted with systems of multiple <unk> and <unk> 
When Felix first opened the door on it, all these shades were tightly 
drawn and the whole studio was as dark as night. He quickly fixed 
that, rolling back the shades on some of the <unk> and adjusting <unk> 
on the others. He flew about the place making these adjustments 
and it was obvious that what he was doing was the fruit of long experience. <unk> of his movements was <unk> There was no process of 
trial and <unk> Starting with the room completely <unk> out, as it 
was when we came in, he <unk> fixed things so that the whole place 
was <unk> in the maximum of light without at any point admitting 
even so much as a crack of <unk>   <unk> something <unk> <unk> I was surprised by what we found. There was no display 
of either works in progress or of finished work. Here and there on 
work table or <unk> stood a shape with a sheet or a <unk> draped 
over it. These shapes might have been <unk> but there was no <unk> 
They were all completely <unk> The equipment was solid and heavy 
and in good condition. Everything was orderly and it seemed to be <unk> for the <unk> comfort, convenience and <unk> There 
were tools about but they were neatly kept. There was no confusion 
and no <unk> <unk> of sheet metal were neatly stacked in <unk> <unk> <unk> NOT <unk> the newspapers the next day. Someone on his <unk> 
he suspected it was Ed <unk> <unk> them and for 
this Andy was grateful.   He finally fell asleep around six in 
the morning with the aid of a sleeping <unk> a <unk> he rarely used, 
and didn't awaken until early afternoon. <unk> flooded him the <unk> he opened his eyes and the sick feeling <unk> his <unk> his window <unk> a beautiful summer day. <unk> 
the same sun was shining upon little <unk> also, and those who had <unk> 
him. But <unk> It was still a very big world, despite all 
the modern <unk> to the <unk>   Hub was sitting in a chair that <unk> the hall door. He was <unk> perhaps the only sleep he'd <unk> He snapped to <unk> at <unk> entrance. <unk> 
Mr& <unk> Nothing new. <unk> of people waiting to see you, <unk>   "Our own people. Questions

got plenty of <unk> Mr& <unk> You want me to call <unk> expecting me <unk> Hub shook his head so Andy told 
him not to <unk> The only reason for <unk> <unk> was to comfort 
or to be <unk> He could not manage the former or expect the <unk> they had nothing to give to each other. The <unk> might 
look peculiar to <unk> but Andy could not bring himself to go through 
the motions simply for the sake of <unk>   He had little 
time to himself, anyway. As the afternoon sped toward evening, 
the suite saw a steady <unk> of <unk> <unk> pass in and out, each 
with his own special problem. <unk> arrived with the <unk> 
They had spent the morning <unk> the act, eliminating all the gay <unk> <unk> and dancing with a view of the best public relations. What 
remained lacked the original <unk> but it was at least <unk> 
as <unk> the tragic circumstances. Raymond <unk> reported that the <unk> had hastily <unk> <unk> <unk> in case it was needed. <unk> <unk> was back and forth on several <unk> first 
to <unk> with Andy on the <unk> of <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> they decided it was <unk> and later to announce that 
a prominent <unk> also an agency <unk> had agreed to fill the <unk> 
open date. And once Bake slipped in, pale and <unk> last <unk> liquor still on his breath with some of today's added to it. 
He asked if there was anything he could do. Andy invented a job to 
keep him <unk> sending him ahead to El <unk> to <unk> last minute <unk>   But from <unk> <unk> they heard <unk> last it was time to <unk> <unk> <unk> about, spotted <unk> in the <unk> so Andy was <unk> away quietly through the <unk> service entrance in a strange car which Hub had <unk> <unk> succeeded in <unk> the curious at the hotel, but 
there was no chance of avoiding them at the <unk> El <unk> 
was surrounded by a <unk> They <unk> the parking <unk> making progress 
by automobile difficult. Long before he reached the protection of 
the stage door, Andy was recognized. Word of his arrival spread through 
the crowd like a <unk> They surged around him, fingers <unk> 
eyes <unk> It was not a hostile gathering but Andy sensed the 
difference from last night's <unk> They had come not 
to admire but to <unk>   "It's worse <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> jammed in every table he could <unk> <unk> the heading of it's an ill wind, et <unk>   <unk> 
was <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> kept their distance, <unk> by the tragedy. But in his dressing room was a large <unk> 
and a card that read, "We're with you all the way". It was signed 
by everyone in the <unk> Andy couldn't help but be <unk> 
He instructed <unk> <unk> to <unk> a note of thanks to be posted 
on the call board.   Bake was waiting to report that Lou <unk> 
had been <unk> up to the point where he could function <unk> <unk> gathered that this had been no small <unk> Bake himself 
looked <unk> any kind of job was better than <unk> told him, <unk> I wish you'd talk to <unk> see if 
some kind of p& <unk> system can be <unk> up outside. It's just barely 
possible with this crowd that the <unk> wasn't able to get 
a table. I wouldn't want him to miss the <unk>   "I'll <unk> <unk> isn't going to like it much, though, giving away 
what he should be <unk>   <unk> wasn't the only one who 
didn't care for <unk> <unk> A short time later, Lieutenant <unk> <unk> into the dressing room. "I got a bone to pick with 
you, Mr& <unk> It's those damn <unk>   Andy <unk> up the revised script he had been <unk> "What about <unk> going to <unk> me up good. My men have been 
here all afternoon, setting up for this thing". <unk> explained 
that, with the <unk> <unk> the police had occupied El <unk> like a <unk> <unk> picture cameras had been installed 
to film the audience, the reservation list was being checked out name 
by name, and a special detail was already at work in the parking lot <unk> automobiles for a possible lead. However, it was virtually <unk> to screen the mob outside, even if <unk> had manpower 
available for the purpose. "I want you to have the speakers taken <unk>   Andy sighed. <unk> like we're never going to see 
eye to eye, <unk> <unk> they tell you what I wanted the p& <unk> system <unk>   "Sure, I know. But it's such a

had gotten stuck with a job too big for his <unk> he had to <unk> to <unk> tested procedures. To act otherwise would be to admit 
his <unk> But, admit or not, <unk> was <unk> The <unk> showed too much planning, the <unk> appeared too <unk> 
to be caught by a <unk>   <unk> performance was scheduled 
for eleven o'clock. He <unk> for a half-hour longer, hoping to 
hear something from <unk> about the <unk> money. Bake and <unk> <unk> on separate <unk> could not reach him at any conceivable <unk> in Los Angeles, nor could they secure any <unk> information <unk> his efforts.   Bake <unk> "The <unk> <unk> 
probably halfway to <unk> with our money by now". When no one <unk> he felt <unk> to <unk> "Just <unk> <unk> popped in to <unk> <unk> <unk> sending up <unk> <unk> You about <unk>   "What's he <unk> <unk> Bake asked. "They're drinking, aren't <unk> We got a bunch of <unk> out there tonight. I guess 
nobody wants to pass out and miss <unk> <unk> added in a 
lower voice but Andy <unk> "They act more like a jury than an <unk>   Andy said, "Well, I guess we can't wait any <unk> <unk> you stick by the stage door. If Rock shows up during 
the <unk> or you hear <unk> give me the <unk> <unk> <unk> said, "I'll stay on the phone, Mr& <unk> There's 
a couple of <unk> I can work <unk>   "You're 
a <unk> but leave one line open. He may try to phone us". Andy <unk> into the <unk> their "good <unk> following him. 
It was what they said before every performance but tonight it sounded <unk> as if he really needed it.   They were right. The <unk> cut to <unk> and hastily <unk> together during the afternoon, 
had not been <unk> sufficiently by anyone. The result had nothing 
of the <unk> pace or <unk> of the previous night. Here's where <unk> would normally step in. But this was no ordinary show and Andy 
knew it. Whether he sang well or badly had nothing to do with it. 
The audience had come not to be entertained but to <unk> <unk> 
hours had changed him from a <unk> to a <unk>   Within this <unk> what followed was <unk> even <unk> <unk> 
the <unk> and the <unk> numbers left little but blues and other songs 
of equal <unk> The effect was as <unk> as a <unk> 
the applause <unk> and <unk> Yet Andy <unk> ahead, <unk> 
the <unk> words as if they possessed real <unk> and <unk> his listeners warmed to him. Their <unk> grew more <unk> 
the evening was still not beyond <unk> not as a show but for 
him as a person.   The worst was yet to come.   As Andy 
reached the <unk> of his act, a subdued <unk> <unk> drew his 
attention to the wings. <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> 
was standing there, <unk> by two men in the uniforms of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was nodding and pointing at the 
large suitcase he held.   Andy felt his heart <unk> heavily with <unk> He waved at <unk> to cut off the <unk> <unk> The music 
died away <unk> He drew a deep breath. <unk> and <unk> 
in place of my regular closing number tonight, I'd like to sing 
something of a different nature for you. <unk> if you <unk> the <unk> <unk>   He sensed rather than heard the <unk> 
that swept across the audience. Nor could he blame them. This particular 
song at this particular time could only be interpreted as the ultimate 
in bad taste, <unk> <unk> beyond the bounds of <unk> <unk> no choice, he plunged into it, anyway, holding onto the <unk> 
for support.   <unk> and <unk> **h"   His 
voice <unk> For the first time in his life he forgot the lyrics <unk>

audience would let him <unk>   They <unk> though <unk> 
they were still <unk> But when he was finally through, their <unk> 
was made apparent. Someone <unk> <unk> then quickly stopped. <unk> the silence was complete. As the lights came up, Andy 
could see that a number of patrons were already on their way toward 
the <unk>   He stumbled <unk> "My <unk> he <unk> <unk> God".   Hub was there to support him. "It's <unk> 
Mr& <unk> The <unk> here, all of it".   At this moment,

in that moment, with a cold sinking of <unk> a dying of old <unk> 
that Mae had spread some kind of word there among the neighbors. <unk> <unk> <unk> but enough. They'd have some suspicions to repeat 
to the police.   Though his inner thoughts <unk> at it, 
he forced himself to think back, <unk> the scene in which Mae claimed 
to have caught him <unk> the child.   It hadn't amounted 
to anything. There had been nothing evil or dirty in his <unk> second scene flashed before his mind, the interior of 
the garage at the new house and the young <unk> girl turning startled 
to meet him, the dim dark and the sudden confusion and fear and then 
the brightness as Mae had clicked on the light.   Suppose the <unk> somehow got hold of <unk>   Well, it hadn't been 
what it seemed, he'd had no idea the girl was in there. He hadn't <unk> her.   And when he came to examine the scene, there was 
a certain <unk> to it, it had the smell of planning, and a swift <unk> darted into his mind.   Too <unk> of course. Mae 
wouldn't have plotted a thing like that. It was just that little <unk> played into her hands. Like this murder.   He leaned 
on the wheel, clutching it, staring into the <unk> and tried to bring 
order into his thoughts. He felt <unk> and sick. There was 
no use <unk> off into a territory of utter <unk> Mae was his <unk> She was married to him for better or for worse. She wouldn't 
be <unk> planning his destruction.   But she was. She <unk> as the conviction of truth roared through him, <unk>

something angry in his <unk> as if he might be waiting to report <unk> Holden stepped on the gas.   A new idea drifted in from <unk> He could go to the police. He could tell them his fears 
of being involved, he could explain what had happened in the old neighborhood 
and how Mae had misunderstood and how she had held it over him- 
the scene was complete in his mind at the moment, even to his 
own <unk> 
and <unk> and <unk> silent <unk> He could throw 
himself on the mercy of the Police Department.   It wasn't 
what Mae would want him to do, though. He was sure of this. Once 
he had abandoned himself to the very <unk> once he had <unk> all 
the <unk> of worry and <unk> there wouldn't be very much for <unk> to do. At that moment, Holden almost slammed on the <unk> to go 
back to Cooper and ask if <unk> was about.   It would be 
such a relief.   What was that old sign, supposed to be painted 
over a door <unk> <unk> hope, all ye who enter <unk> Holden said to himself, surprised at his own sudden <unk>

If <unk> car had been in sight, Holden would have walked

in.   Mae entered the room from the hallway to the kitchen. 
She had a cup of something <unk> coffee perhaps, in one hand, a <unk> piece of toast in the other. She stood there, watching Holden 
come in, and she put the piece of toast in her mouth and bit off one corner 
with a huge <unk> of her white teeth.   <unk> been <unk> she said, <unk> the <unk> <unk>

that he was, on a hunch basis, eliminating a good many. He reminded 
himself that all <unk> were <unk> He also reminded himself 
that he had an unusual number of <unk>   The <unk>

man named <unk> <unk> <unk> had expressed a wish that <unk> Payne drop dead. He would say, of course, that he had not 
really had any such <unk> that what he had said was no more than one 
of those things one does say, <unk> meaning nothing. Which probably 
would turn out to be <unk> which he obviously had to be given the 
opportunity to say.   A man named <unk> <unk> with <unk> 
and <unk> but pronounced without them, had been fired at <unk> <unk> He was also, if Pam North was right, a closer acquaintance 
of Lauren <unk> than she, now, was inclined to <unk> 
He might deny the <unk> would certainly deny any connection between 
the two things, or any connection of either with murder. He would 
have to be given the opportunity.   <unk> It was evident 
that <unk> was the man to go. It was evident that a captain should <unk> at his desk, directing with a firm hand and keeping a firm seat. <unk> <unk> was good and tired of the wall <unk> and the crack

Of four dark brown ears, one <unk> slightly at this. "All right", <unk> said. "I know it isn't <unk>   But at 
this the one <unk> cat suddenly became two cats, <unk> <unk> 
the more <unk> began at once to talk, her voice <unk> <unk>

and leaned back on a <unk> and considered pulling her thoughts together. 
After a time, it occurred to her that her thoughts were not worth

If Arthur Williams was involved in the <unk> or the murder, then he 
too had another identity. No one the <unk> police had questioned <unk> to know any more about him than about <unk>   <unk> <unk> <unk> looked <unk> Madden explained that 
he was thinking of an application sent directly to Mrs& <unk> 
Then he asked to use the phone and called <unk> Thayer, who said that 
he was just leaving to keep a lunch date but would be home by two <unk>   Madden said that he would see him at two and made another <unk> this one to Mrs& Meeker's <unk> Mr& Hohlbein 
was out for the day, but Mr& Garth would be free at <unk> The <unk> tone indicated that an appointment at such short notice 
was a <unk> for which Madden should be duly grateful. 
He <unk> that Hohlbein and Garth were <unk> <unk> had lunch with <unk> <unk> at <unk> he entered Hohlbein 
and <unk> elegant suite of offices in <unk> newest 
professional building.   He disliked Garth on sight, conservative <unk> and <unk> smile a shade too earnestly <unk> for a man 
who must be well into his <unk> <unk> too consciously quick and <unk> <unk> man on the <unk> Madden labeled him, and was ready 
to guess that in a <unk> not too pushing fashion, the junior partner 
of the firm had political <unk> that Mrs& Garth would be <unk> suitable as the wife of a rising young <unk> that there 
were three children, two boys and a <unk> that she was active in the <unk> Club and he in <unk> <unk> and <unk> and finally, 
that neither of them had <unk> an <unk> opinion since their <unk> day.   Madden knew that he could be completely wrong about 
all this, but also knew that he would go right on <unk> <unk> was prepared to be helpful in what he referred to with <unk> distaste as this unfortunate Johnston affair, which would <unk> he said more than once, have ever come about if Mrs& Meeker 
had only seen fit to consult Mr& Hohlbein or him about it. <unk> regretted not being able to find fault with so true a statement. 
He asked to see a copy of Mrs& Meeker's will.   Garth 
brought one out.   The date, October 8, 1957, immediately caught 
the <unk> eye. <unk> <unk> he <unk> <unk> she 
in the habit of making new <unk>   "Oh no. She had reason 
to change the one she made right after Mr& Meeker's death. Her 
estate had grown <unk> She wanted to make a more equitable 
distribution of it among the groups that would benefit the <unk> particularly 
the scholarship <unk> At the time the will was drawn Mr& <unk> mentioned to me how mentally alert she seemed for her age, <unk> just what changes she wanted made and so <unk>   Garth <unk> "Mr& Hohlbein and I have noticed some <unk> <unk> <unk> Most of them this past year, I'd say.

With her sharp tongue she'd have cut his <unk> to <unk> 
It would have been Hohlbein who handled her affairs.   Madden 
settled back to read the will.   He skimmed over the millions 
that went to Meeker Park, <unk> Hospital, the civic center, 
the Public Health <unk> Association, the library, and so on, <unk> 
when he came to the scholarship <unk> Two millions were added to

with <unk> who shrugged it off. "Old people have their <unk> one came a bit high at thirty thousand or <unk> she had a number of them where money was <unk> <unk> said. <unk> we'd have trouble <unk> her to

No <unk>

didn't know him very well although he saw him occasionally at some

man so <unk> by <unk> and found him easy enough to talk to. 
But he didn't play <unk> didn't seem to belong to any local <unk> 
his work took him away a <unk> of <unk> which probably accounted 
for his tendency to keep to himself.   <unk> glance began 
to <unk> to his watch.   He said that he had already told the 
police chief that he didn't know what insurance man had recommended <unk> to Mrs& <unk> He would offer no theory to account 
for her murder. The whole thing, his manner <unk> was so far outside 
the normal routine of Hohlbein and Garth that it practically demanded 
being swept under the <unk>   No doubt Mrs& Meeker had <unk> him many a time and he felt no <unk> over her passing. Even so, <unk> dislike of the <unk> correct lawyer <unk> It would 
be all right with him, he decided, if his investigation of the <unk> 
with its probable <unk> of murder, led to <unk> door. <unk> <unk> <unk> At first <unk> not much of a motive 
for a man of his <unk> but for all his air of <unk> who 
could tell what his private financial picture <unk>   The <unk> 
knew as he left that this was wishful thinking. Nevertheless, 
he made a mental note to look into <unk> financial <unk> Thayer had a downtown address. He lived in an apartment 
house not over three or four years old, a <unk> island of <unk> <unk> and glass on the fringe of the business district.   He <unk> a <unk> apartment on the fourth floor, using the second 
bedroom as his office. <unk> and bright, the apartment was furnished 
with good modern furniture, <unk> and <unk> <unk> by a professional <unk> Madden thought, and somehow as <unk> as <unk> 
as its <unk> In <unk> the rent would run close to two hundred 
a <unk> in <unk> perhaps twenty-five less, not all of it 
paid by Thayer, who could charge off one room on his expense <unk> took Madden into the room he used as an office. It contained 
a desk, <unk> a typewriter on a stand, and two big leather <unk> 
A newspaper open at <unk> reports lay on one of them. Thayer <unk> it up and offered a drink.   The <unk> <unk> 
To begin the interview, he asked if Thayer, with more time to think

He bit out the words. "And you know I can do it".   Griffith 
raised <unk> hands. <unk> does it, Phil. I was just going. 
I'm on my way". He turned and fled into the house and made 
his way up the marble stairs without once looking back. On the second <unk> he paused to look for <unk> didn't see him, and accepted 
a glass of <unk> He took several large <unk> <unk> 
that Docherty had gone up another <unk> and decided he would be wise

to the next <unk> At the top a uniformed officer blocked further <unk> "Yes, what is it"? he asked.   "I want Captain <unk> He spotted Docherty coming out of a room at the far 
end of the corridor and called to him.   Docherty said, "It's <unk> <unk> let him <unk> They walked toward each other. <unk>   Griffith said, <unk> told me to tell you"- 
he waited until they were <unk> it was <unk> <unk> <unk> to let the prime minister be alone with <unk>   Griffith

"Why <unk>   "He claims <unk> in a plot to kill

he wouldn't dare try anything now- not after Docherty had looked 
in on the two of them to see that all was well. Docherty was damned 
if he would make a fool of himself again the way he had earlier over 
the <unk> truck. One more <unk> play like that one and they'd 
be leading him away. Still, this had to be checked out.   <unk> 
your friend Hoag get his <unk> he <unk> the <unk> <unk>   "Would you mind <unk> him up here? I'd like to talk to him". <unk> he continued 
along the <unk> <unk> his head into the next office for 
a careful look around. <unk> Hoag had not stayed on the front 
steps when Griffith disappeared into the building. He was unwilling 
to rely on <unk> carrying his message, and he had no confidence 
the police would act on it. If Mahzeer was alone with the prime minister 
he could be arranging his execution while Hoag stood out here <unk> in the <unk> street. He would have to do something on his <unk> But what?   The door opened and three men and a woman 
in a <unk> swept past him and down the stairs. In the lighted interior 
he saw other men and women struggling into their <unk> These were 
the early <unk> in half an hour the reception would be over. If <unk> was planning to set up the prime minister for Muller he would 
have to do it in the next few minutes. Hoag descended the stone 
steps to the street and looked up at the building. <unk> windows with 
many small <unk> <unk> swept across the upper <unk> On the second 
floor he saw the animated faces of the party <unk> the scene looked 
like a Christmas <unk> On the third floor one of the two windows 
was <unk> it was framed in <unk> <unk> and no faces were <unk> 
This would be <unk> office. He and the prime minister would 
be back from the window, seated at <unk> <unk> they would 
be going over papers Mahzeer had saved as excuse for just such a meeting. 
In a minute, or five minutes, the business would be <unk> Mahzeer 
would stand up, the prime minister would follow. Mahzeer would direct 
the prime <unk> attention to something out the window and 
would guide him forward and then step to one side. The single shot would <unk> Hoag would carry its sound to his <unk> <unk> of course, 
would be <unk> How was he to suspect that an <unk> had been <unk> somewhere across the street waiting for just such a <unk> <unk> Where across the <unk> Where was Muller 
waiting with the <unk> <unk> <unk> buildings ran the length 
of the block like books tightly packed on a <unk> Most of them could 
be <unk> <unk> would have to be one of the half dozen 
almost directly <unk> The <unk> was generously set back from

He ran his eye along the roof <unk> almost at once a figure <unk> up. But <unk> <unk> on the dark form were the buttons and <unk> of a <unk> With a cop <unk> the road Muller would 
have to be inside a <unk> if he was here at all, and not waiting 
for the prime minister somewhere between this street and the terminal 
building at La <unk> <unk>   Hoag crossed the narrow street, <unk> between parked cars to reach the <unk> From this 
side he could see farther into the <unk> <unk> window, but 
he saw no <unk> the <unk> occupants were still seated or they 
had been called into the hallway by an <unk> police <unk> If only 
the latter were true **h. He walked rapidly along the buildings <unk> 
their <unk> one was a <unk> that was <unk> two others he <unk> out because all their windows were <unk> That left <unk> possibly <unk> one looking much like the next. He climbed the steps of 
the first and opened the door to the <unk> He quickly closed it 
again. He had assumed that all these buildings had been divided into <unk> but this one, from a glance at the hall <unk> was 
obviously still a <unk> town house, and its owners were in <unk> 
that made it doubtful as the hiding place of a man whose plans 
had to be made in advance.   He went on to the next building and 
found what he <unk> the mingled cooking <unk> of a public <unk> 
On one wall was the brass front of a row of <unk> there 
were six <unk> Now what? The names on the <unk> meant 
nothing to him. This was <unk> he had no idea what to look for. 
He peered in the boxes <unk> all were empty except one, and 
that one was jammed with letters and <unk> The occupants of <unk> <unk> 3 were probably away for a few days, and not likely to 
return on a Friday. Had Muller made the same <unk> Muller 
was attracted to the <unk> of <unk>   He opened the inner <unk> 
the cooking <unk> were <unk> all over the city, at this hour, <unk> 
would be <unk> over <unk> He <unk> as quickly as he could urge 
his body, up the two unbroken flights to the third floor, pulling 
himself along on a delicate <unk> all that remained of the <unk> <unk> He paused on the landing to steady his breathing and 
then bent to examine the single door by the light of the weak <unk> <unk> Now he was <unk> the lock had not yielded to <unk> 
collection of <unk> fresh scars showed that the door had been <unk> open. It had been shut again, but the lock was <unk> he noted 
with a <unk> of fear that the door moved under his touch. 
What was he to do now? He had thought no further than finding <unk> 
He realized now he had more than half hoped he wouldn't find <unk> that Muller would not be here, that the attempt would be scheduled 
for somewhere beyond <unk> control. He could not break in on 
an armed man. He would have to climb back down to the street and signal 
a <unk> Was there <unk>   His thoughts were scattered by 
the sharp report of a rifle from the other side of the door. Hoag pushed 
open the <unk> at the far end of the long dark room Muller was <unk> <unk> against the window, the rifle still <unk> he stood 
with his feet apart on a kitchen table he had dragged to the <unk> 
He turned his head to the source of the disturbance and instantly back 
to the window and his rifle sight, <unk> Hoag for the moment 
with the same contempt he had shown in their encounter at <unk> <unk> stretched his left hand to the wall and <unk> 
for the <unk> evil <unk> in the dark. The room was <unk> in 
light at the instant <unk> second shot came. <unk> <unk> <unk> at the bright window like a <unk> <unk> in a car's <unk> <unk> down the rifle and turned to jump from the <unk> his face 
wore a look of <unk> A shot caught him and straightened him up in <unk> <unk> a following <unk> of shots shattered glass, <unk> 
the <unk> and sent him <unk> heavily from the table. He was dead 
before his body made contact with the floor. Hoag stumbled back into 
the hall, leaned against the wall, and started to <unk> <unk> <unk> Docherty sent <unk> Griffith for Hoag he was able to 
complete his detailed inspection of the third floor and to receive a 
report from his man covering the <unk> above before Griffith <unk> <unk> up by a brief stop for another glass of <unk> safe at <unk> District Station stands next to the gum <unk> in a narrow <unk> that leads to Captain <unk> office <unk> the <unk> the <unk> office <unk> along and to the <unk> and the <unk> supply closet <unk> <unk>   The <unk> is a <unk> for three dead <unk> <unk> a hundred

in any time they <unk> <unk>   "No, sir". <unk> 
in, running out. Can't have it. <unk> for confusion and <unk> He rocked back in the chair, knee locked against stomach, 
his <unk> eyes fixed on <unk>   He was silent again, possibly <unk> to the sounds in the <unk> <unk> was being called. <unk> cleared his throat.   Killpath said, "You were expected 
to report to 
my office twenty minutes ago, <unk> That's not getting 
all the juice out of the <unk> now is it"?   "No, <unk> Killpath smiled. Gun knew that nothing but <unk> back 
to back would give the lieutenant an <unk> and a smile at the same <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Lt& <unk> was calling 
out the beat <unk> but <unk> couldn't make the names mean <unk>   "I called the station at three this <unk> <unk> <unk> voice <unk> "Do you have any idea who might

but a couple of <unk>   <unk> <unk> knows better 
than to leave the station without a relief. He must <unk> let a patrolman take over the duties of the station <unk> Now <unk> not <unk> is it"?   "No, sir". 
"But you didn't know a thing about it, did you"? Killpath leaned <unk> his foot slipped off the chair and he put it back again, <unk> now. "That's not taking one's command with a responsible <unk> <unk>   Gun told himself that the old bastard 
was a <unk> But <unk> was no <unk> when it had <unk> was out in the district, sir".   "Oh, yes. So 
I have <unk> He stretched a pale hand out to the scattered papers 
on his desk. "I might point out that your inability to report to 
my office this morning when you were instructed to do so has not **h <unk> 
**h limited my knowledge of your activities as you may have <unk> 
He took up a white sheet of paper, dark with <unk> <unk> car pulled into the driveway outside the window. Gun knew it 
was <unk> 12, the wagon, returned from delivering <unk> <unk> 
to the City <unk> But for some fool reason he couldn't 
remember which men he'd put on the transfer detail. He stared 
at the report in <unk> hand, sure it was written by <unk> 
just as sure as if he'd submitted it in his <unk> <unk> He <unk> in his breath and kept quiet while Killpath laid down the sheet 
again, wound the <unk> stems of his glasses around his ears and 
then, <unk> the report as it lay before him on the desk, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> one failed to see that the station <unk> was properly relieved two <unk> himself throughout the entire 
watch without <unk> on the <unk> activities or the <unk> 
of his section <unk> three permitted members of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> Bureau to <unk> for their own convenience 
a patrolman who was thereby prevented from carrying on his proper 
assignment four failed to notify the station commander Acting Captain <unk> T& Killpath of a <unk> occurring in the district five <unk> <unk> establishments known as <unk> spots for <unk> of an unofficial and <unk> social nature and <unk> 
he leaned back and <unk> off his glasses <unk> failed to <unk> 
with the Acting Captain by returning promptly when so ordered. What 
have you to say to that, <unk> Killpath sailed the paper 
across the desk, but <unk> didn't pick it up or even glance at <unk>   "I didn't think <unk> knew so 
many big words, <unk>   Killpath licked his lips. <unk> <unk> is an alert and conscientious <unk> officer. 
I don't think his <unk> <unk> your <unk> <unk> <unk> Gun held his breath a moment, <unk> 
the volume and pitch of his voice down under the <unk> in his <unk> <unk> I would have been <unk> and a <unk> <unk> cop to <unk> if I'd sat around this station all night when somebody got 
away with murder in my district. It's too bad I didn't call you, 
and it's too bad I let <unk> use <unk> when he could have 
had a boy who'd be glad to learn something of <unk> procedure. 
But I'm not one damned bit sorry I went out to question the people 
I know in the places they hang around, <unk>   "Let's 
not push our patience beyond the danger line, <unk> Killpath <unk> "I shouldn't like to have to write you up for <unk> 
as well as <unk> of <unk>   Gun <unk> his hands <unk> into fists at his sides. He clamped his <unk> to keep the <unk> from <unk> out. An argument with <unk> <unk> Killpath 
was as <unk> and as futile as a cap pistol on a firing <unk> leaned forward again, rocked comfortably with his arms 
still wrapped around one knee. "Let's just remember, <unk> 
that we must all carry our own <unk> A district station can't 
run <unk> <unk> He interrupted himself, looking around Gun 
at the doorway. <unk> Lieutenant <unk>   <unk> <unk> I thought you hadn't come in <unk>   "I've 
been here for some time". He stood up, <unk> his head and eyed Gun <unk> "The sergeant is just <unk> <unk> had come as 
no great surprise to <unk> that the hot water in the <unk> didn't 
work, that <unk> <unk> had thrown up all over the stairs, or that 
some <unk> bastard of a cop had walked off with his <unk> It 
was the best he could hope for on a watch that had ended with a session 
in <unk> office.   Now, as he passed the open counter 
that divided the assembly room from the business office, he nodded 
and said good night to the station <unk> and his <unk> not stopping 
to hear the <unk> <unk> of his chewing out.   Not that he 
gave a damn what the <unk> sent out about <unk> little speech 
on the <unk> of <unk> <unk> He just didn't want 
to talk about it. If the acting captain wanted his acting lieutenant 
to sit on his <unk> around the station all night, Killpath would just 
have to go out and drag Gun back by the heels once an <unk> because 
he'd be damned if he was going to be a <unk> <unk> just 
to please his <unk> <unk> <unk>   At the <unk> he <unk> 
up at the gray morning overcast and patted his jacket pockets for 
the <unk> remembering then that he'd left them at the <unk> 
He could pick up another pack on his way home, if he were going 
home. But even before he started across the <unk> road to his <unk> <unk> in the lot under the <unk> trees across from the station, 
he knew that he wasn't going home.   Not yet.   It 
was nine o'clock in the <unk> the hour which, like a <unk> turning <unk> of earth, exposed to the day a myriad of busy creatures that 
had <unk> <unk> in the quiet night. Mission Street at this hour was <unk> by a whole community that Gun could not have seen on his <unk> of <unk> the neighborhood that had known <unk> <unk> by 
day. <unk> Phillips had purchased the <unk> <unk> <unk> seventeen years ago. It was <unk> worth three thousand dollars 
in stock and good will, and the name was written in gold in <unk> 
letters across each of the two display windows.   On the right <unk> at eye level, in smaller print but also in gold, was <unk> <unk> and under that, <unk> <unk> <unk> Mr& Phillips 
took a razor to <unk> <unk> but left the promise 
that Spanish would be understood because he thought it meant that Spanish <unk> would be <unk> <unk> was no problem <unk> 
Mr& Phillips had only to signal from his <unk> to <unk> aid from 
the <unk> <unk> children who played on the <unk> of Mission <unk>   <unk> from the fact that business was slow this 
time 
of year and his one <unk> was not the most <unk> Mr& <unk> had no worries at all, and he said as much to Gun <unk> 
who sat across from him in civilian clothes, on a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>   "She's honest 
as the day", Mr& Phillips said, and added, "Mr& <unk> 
I can say this to <unk> <unk> is a little too <unk> You can't 
tell a customer how much it's going to cost him to <unk> his payments 
before he even signs for a loan on the money <unk> A time plan 
is a mere <unk> you understand, and <unk> He interrupted 
himself, <unk> "I put her in <unk> That way I don't lose 
so much".   "Why don't you just hire somebody <unk> says she has to finish a <unk> He shrugged. "I 
asked her why she couldn't do it tomorrow, but it seems the <unk> is 
working good tonight and she's afraid to let it go".   Casey 
made some <unk> but his mind was busy as he considered the man. His 
name was George <unk> and he, too, had come from a good family. 
He was perhaps <unk> <unk> set up, with light brown hair that 
had a pronounced <unk> He was always well <unk> and well <unk> 
and he had that rich man's look which was authentic enough and came 
from two good <unk> schools and a proper university. An only child, he 
had done all the things that young men do who have been born to money 
and social position until his father <unk> him by dying <unk> 
Since then he had worked at this and that, though some said his main 
interest was <unk>   All this went through <unk> mind 
in the first instant, but what held his interest was the fact that 
these two should be together at all. For he had understood that <unk> 
had been engaged to a boy named <unk> <unk> She had grown up with 
young <unk> and he had heard that they had been at the point of 
getting married at least twice. He wanted to ask her about Jenkins 
now, but he knew he couldn't do so in <unk> <unk> And so, 
still wondering and a little <unk> he grinned at the girl and 
spoke lightly to make sure that she would know he was <unk> <unk> did you pick him <unk>   "Oh, I've known him quite 
a <unk> She glanced at her companion <unk> <unk> I, <unk>   "I've been after her for <unk> <unk> 
said, "but I've never been able to get anywhere until the last 
few <unk>   The girl's eyes were softly shining as she reached 
out and touched <unk> hand. "Can I tell you a <unk> <unk> going to get married. Do you <unk>   Casey kept 
his smile <unk> but some small inner disturbance was working on him 
as 
he thought again about <unk> who was eight or ten years older than 
the girl. He wondered whether <unk> was going to swear off gambling 
and get a steady job or whether he was counting on the income from <unk> estate to <unk> him. None of this showed in his face, 
and he tried to keep his <unk> in hand. He made a point of <unk> 
of acting out the part of the fond <unk>   "I'll 
have to give it some <unk> he said. "You wouldn't want 
me to say <unk> without making sure his intentions are <unk> would <unk>   She made a face at him and then she laughed. "Of 
course not".   "I'll get my references in <unk> <unk> 
said, and though he spoke with a smile, Casey somehow got the idea 
that he was not particularly <unk> <unk> by any time, <unk> 
He stood up and touched the girl's arm. "Come on, <unk> If 
you're really serious about working on that story, I'd better take 
you home".   Casey watched them go, still <unk> absently 
and then <unk> the matter as he called for his <unk> As he went 
out he told <unk> the dinner was <unk> and when he got his hat 
and coat from <unk> <unk> and put a <unk> piece in the <unk> 
he told her to be sure that it went toward her <unk>   A taxi 
took him back to the bar and grill where he had left his car, and a few 
minutes later he found a parking place across the street from his apartment. 
Because his mind had been otherwise occupied for the past couple 
of hours, he did not think to look and see if Jerry <unk> 
car was still there. In fact, he did not think about Jerry Burton at 
all until he entered his living room and closed the door behind him. 
Only then, when his glance focused on the <unk> and saw that it was <unk> did he remember his earlier problem.   Even from where he 
stood he could see the neatly folded blanket that he had spread over <unk> the <unk> the sheet of paper on top of it. Then he was <unk> 
across the room, his thoughts confused but the worry building swiftly 
inside him as he snatched up the <unk> <unk> <unk> in 
the <unk> I knew the only way I could beat you was to play <unk> 
but it was a good <unk> <unk> and I appreciate it.   <unk> <unk> 

The <unk> stood near the wall next to the <unk> and the instant <unk> picked it up he knew what had happened. The discarded papers 
inside were <unk> there was a <unk> of liquid at the bottom, and 
the smell of whisky was strong and <unk> He put the basket down <unk> <unk> softly and thoroughly disgusted with himself 
and his plan that had seemed so <unk> For he remembered too well 
how he had brought back the loaded drinks to Burton and then returned 
to the kitchen to get weaker drinks for himself.   For another 
second or two he gave in to the <unk> that was directed at <unk> 
then his mind moved on to be confronted by something far more <unk> and as the thought <unk> the implications <unk> him. It 
no longer <unk> that Burton had <unk> him. The important thing 
was that Burton had gone somewhere to meet a <unk> with a gun 
in his pocket. And that gun was <unk>   Even before his mind 
had rounded out the idea, he thrust one hand into his <unk> pocket 
and pulled out the six <unk> he had taken from the <unk> He considered 
them with brooding eyes, <unk> <unk> as his brain <unk> with 
the problem and tried to find some solution. He said: "The crazy <unk> half <unk> He put the shells on the table, as though he 
could no longer bear to hold them. He <unk> <unk> the hell 
could he have <unk> How can I find <unk>   There was no answer 
to this and he began to pace back and forth across the room, his <unk> out of control. He tried to tell himself that maybe Burton 
had <unk> up enough to get some sense. Maybe he only intended to <unk> the <unk> <unk> he was, in which case an <unk> gun 
would be good enough. He thought of other <unk> none of them <unk> and finally he began to think, to wonder if there was 
some way he could reach <unk> Then, as he turned toward the <unk> 
it rang <unk> to <unk> the stillness in the room and he reached 
for it <unk>   <unk> he said.   <unk>   <unk> <unk>   Casey heard 
the voice distinctly and he knew who it was, but it took him a while to 
make the mental <unk> and control the disturbance inside his 
head. When he heard <unk> say: "What about that picture you took 
this <unk> it still took him another few seconds to remember 
the job he had done for Frank <unk>   "What <unk> 
he demanded.   "You took a picture of me at the corner of 
Washington and <unk> about three thirty this <unk> <unk> says <unk>   "One of my <unk>   Casey believed 
that much. <unk> was not the sort who walked around without one 
of his <unk> close at hand.   <unk>   "With 
my trial coming up in Federal Court next week I wouldn't want that 
picture <unk>   "Who says it's going to be <unk> wouldn't even want it to get <unk> normal circumstances Casey was a little <unk> when people told 
him what to do with pictures he had <unk> Even so, he generally listened 
and was usually reasonable to those who voiced their objections <unk> Right now, however, he was still too worried about Jerry <unk> and the gun that had no <unk> and the story Burton had told 
him, to care too much about Tony <unk> His nerves were getting 
a little ragged and his impatience put an edge in his voice. <unk> he said. "I was hired to take a picture. I took it. <unk> all I know about it and that's all I <unk>   "Maybe <unk> better tell the guy who hired you what I <unk> tell him".   "All right", <unk> said, his voice 
still quiet. "But I meant what I said, <unk> If that picture 
gets around and I find out you had anything to do with it, I'm 
going to send a couple of my boys around to see you".   "You 
do that", Casey said. "Just be sure to send your two best boys, <unk>   He hung up with a <unk> annoyed at himself for running 
off at the mouth like that but still terribly concerned with the situation 
he had helped to <unk> As soon as he could think logically 
again he reached for the telephone <unk> and found Jerry <unk> 
home number. He <unk> it and listened to it ring ten times before 
he hung up. He called the bar and grill where he had picked Burton 
up that afternoon. When he was told that no one had seen Burton since 
then, he thought of three other places that were <unk> Each 
time he got the same answer and in the end he gave up.   By 
the time he had smoked three cigarettes he had <unk> down. He had done 
all he could and that was that. And <unk> Burton was not the kind 
of guy who would be likely to get in trouble even when he was drunk. <unk> <unk> had been scared for a while, but that had come mostly from 
the fact that he felt <unk> He should have stayed here and 
watched <unk> He didn't. So he made a <unk> So <unk> kept telling himself this as he went out to the kitchen to make 
a drink. Only then did he decide he didn't want one. He considered <unk> a can of beer but <unk> that idea too. Finally he went into 
the bedroom and sat down to take off his shoes. He had just finished <unk> the right one when the telephone rang again. When he snatched 
it up the voice that came to him was quick and <unk>   <unk> 
You don't know me but I know you. If you want a picture 
get to the corner of Adams and Clark just as fast as you can. If you <unk> you might beat the headquarters <unk>   Casey heard the <unk> of the distant receiver before he could open his mouth, and it 
took him no more than three seconds to make his decision. For over 
the years he had received many such <unk> Some of them came from people 
who identified themselves. Some telephoned because he had done 
them a favor in the past. Others because they expected some sort of <unk> for the information. A few passed along a tip for the simple 
reason that they liked him and wanted to give him a <unk> Only 
an occasional tip turned out to be a <unk> and, like the police, Casey 
had made a point of running down all such suggestions and he did not <unk> this time.   He was in his car with his camera and equipment <unk> in less than two minutes, and it took him only three more 
to reach the corner, a block from Columbus <unk> It was a district 
of small factories and <unk> buildings and occasional <unk> and 
he could see the police radio car as he rounded the corner and slammed 
on the <unk> He did not bother with his <unk> there would be time 
for that <unk> but as he scrambled out on the <unk> he saw the <unk> station and the public telephone <unk> and knew instantly how 
he had been <unk>   The police car had pulled up behind a 
small <unk> its headlights still <unk> he pulled out the hand <unk> until the boat was moving 
at 
little more than a <unk> and watched Elaine rapidly <unk> from one 
station to another, <unk> in the <unk> then draw in a line on the <unk> <unk> out just a little too far. Make a 90 degree straight 
for <unk>   Poet came in, raising his eyebrows <unk> 
as he saw <unk> <unk> he asked.   <unk> <unk> 
she replied. "Will you drop the <unk>   Poet <unk> <unk> below and a moment later emerged from the forward <unk> where 
he picked up the <unk> The rock and roll music coming from the radio 
station suddenly faded as the boat <unk> into the null on the <unk> Elaine said, then peered through the loop 
of the <unk> and waved to Poet. A second later she came behind 
the wheel and backed off the anchor line until it was set in the ocean 
floor. She cut the engines and slowly the <unk> swung around on 
the end of its lines until its bow was pointing into the wind and the <unk> faced toward the shore. Nick watched her somewhat <unk> as 
she efficiently cut the <unk> and started the <unk> <unk> came up from below, wearing new bathing <unk> The price <unk> hung from the belt and he pulled it off as he entered the <unk> 
and looked at it <unk> Nick wondered if Elaine had bought them, 
but he said nothing. <unk> he suddenly realized, was saying anything. 
It seemed as if they were all under a <unk> There should be an <unk> conversation, for <unk> directly below them, was a <unk> 
lost for more than four hundred years.   But instead of chatter 
there was a <unk> like on the radio direction <unk> Once, in New <unk> he had gone flying with some friends in a small private airplane 
with a single <unk> They had all been laughing, <unk> when 
suddenly the engine had failed. No one had screamed. No one had <unk> 
All had fallen into a complete silence, listening to the wind <unk> 
over the wings. The pilot had been good. He'd landed the plane 
on a small <unk> in Connecticut and as soon as the aircraft had <unk> to a stop, everyone had burst into chatter at the same <unk> had been tension in the plane during the silent <unk> 
a tension similar to the one now. But in the plane there was a concrete 
reason for it. Now, at this moment, there should be none **h unless <unk> <unk> was much more dangerous than he had been led to believe. 
Yet tension existed. The same <unk> relationship as there 
had been between the passengers on the plane now strained at the three 
of them here on the boat. It hung over them like a <unk> its arrival 
as sudden as a cloud <unk> over the sun.   <unk> Elaine <unk> up her keys from the table and went out into the <unk> Poet 
behind her, Nick trailing behind him. She threw back a cushion over 
one of the <unk> unlocked a <unk> on the chest beneath it, then <unk> <unk> holding a long knife and a <unk> looking spear <unk> in her hand.   Poet whistled softly as he looked at the gun. <unk> he asked.   Elaine nodded. "They are the <unk> She kicked the <unk> lid shut and replaced the <unk> 
"They are the most <unk>   "And the <unk> Poet <unk> as he <unk> on his tank <unk>   "Why do you 
need an <unk> Nick asked, <unk> staring at the <unk> quite possible there's more than <unk> down 
there, man", Poet replied with a short, nervous laugh as he held 
the <unk> for <unk>   A moment later, moving <unk> because 
of the swimming <unk> she picked up the gun, handed the knife to <unk> 
then rolled off the transom of the boat, back first. Poet nodded 
to Nick and entered the water in a similar fashion. Another moment 
and they were out of sight, leaving behind only a string of bubbles as 
a clue to their <unk>   For a while Nick followed the <unk> course of the <unk> wondering which set came from <unk> 
They remained close together, their air trail <unk> like <unk> <unk> side by side. Eventually the bubbles became lost in the <unk> 
of the ocean surface, and he rolled over on his back.   <unk> 
his hands behind his head, he stared at the blue sky. There was 
nothing quite like being alone on a boat on the <unk> <unk> certainly 
must have enjoyed being alone. Next to the ocean, probably the <unk> spot was the <unk> If <unk> uncle had stuck to this 
desire for <unk> he probably would still be alive.   Yet <unk> 
wanted money **h wanted money to <unk> through the <unk> And <unk> wanted money probably to <unk> among the dice tables in <unk> <unk> It was an odd combination **h a strange pair to <unk> upon 
the <unk> of the <unk> But Graham hadn't stumbled on it. 
Two to three weeks prior to the charter of the <unk> Graham 
had been <unk> around the San Luis <unk> <unk>   The small <unk> with its two steel <unk> <unk> <unk> and Nick raised 
up to watch it heading <unk> That was a hell of a note, he thought. 
A couple couldn't even find a <unk> spot anywhere on a beach 
to neck nowadays without someone <unk> down upon them. If the character <unk> that thing had gone over San <unk> Island yesterday 
he would have had an <unk>   <unk> to the west a beautiful <unk> 
slowly beat its way into the wind, headed on a <unk> toward San <unk> Behind it a cabin <unk> drifted <unk> in the small <unk> a lone <unk> in the chair <unk> The <unk> was right 
in the middle of the <unk> Nick recalled stories that the two best <unk> spots in Southern California were over the La <unk> <unk> 
and the <unk> <unk> two spots where the ocean dropped off to fantastic <unk> almost from the <unk>   <unk> <unk> 
had <unk> the land on both sides of these <unk> would fall into the <unk> and no more La <unk> or <unk> <unk> Meanwhile, fishermen 
took advantage of them to pull up <unk> Sometimes the fish exploded 
as they <unk> the surface because of the difference in <unk> he <unk> had Elaine wanted him along on this <unk> 
He couldn't <unk> he couldn't run a boat, except on the open <unk> He stood up, <unk> looked around for the <unk> but could 
see <unk> <unk> down to the <unk> he lit the <unk> under the <unk> pot and when the <unk> was <unk> poured himself a cup and went 
up to the <unk> Turning on the <unk> he went back to the <unk> <unk> out on the <unk> and listened to the music.   Elaine 
and Poet returned together, <unk> up over the transom almost 
like <unk> breaking water.   He sat up and watched as they pulled 
themselves over the <unk> <unk> <unk> he asked.   Poet 
shook his head, sliding his face mask up on his <unk> <unk> right on the edge of the <unk> Elaine said. <unk> 
off her face <unk> she carefully placed the spear gun across the <unk> 
then lifted her wet hair from her back and squeezed out the water. <unk> 
is a break as the area to search is less than a square <unk> 
she added as she swung her legs over the <unk> <unk> <unk> a thing". He tossed her a <unk> then repeated the 
service for Poet. <unk>   Elaine shook her head 
as she slipped out of her <unk> but Poet nodded. His feet still hung 
over the stern of the <unk> but as he reached for the smoke he 
raised them to swing them in. The <unk> on his foot caught on the <unk> <unk> him off balance. His <unk> smashed painfully into the <unk> <unk> and he <unk> as he grabbed his <unk> <unk> with 
his other hand and rolled into the boat.   <unk> The 
word <unk> distinctly from <unk> lips as he struggled to his <unk> body became <unk> Turning slowly he saw Poet 
in a brilliant <unk> of <unk> <unk> His face was still <unk> in <unk> as he studied the <unk> of his arm. Poet a <unk> Turning <unk> toward <unk> Nick saw that she, too, stood in shocked <unk>   The sudden silence was too silent. <unk> 
aware of the charged atmosphere, Poet raised his head slowly, looking 
first at <unk>   She had caught the implication of the <unk> 
Her face was frozen into the mask of a <unk> her body absolutely <unk>   And then Nick knew that all of them knew **h <unk> 
himself **h and Poet.   Elaine <unk> first, so quickly 
that Nick thought he might have imagined her sudden reaction. "Do 
you need a <unk> she asked <unk>   Poet rubbed 
his arm. "It's like <unk> a <unk> he said, his eyes <unk> 
on <unk> face, then moved back to <unk> <unk> like hell for 
a second, then it <unk>   "I'll get some <unk> <unk> turned and started toward the <unk> But her walk 
was too <unk> too <unk> <unk> her fear.   Nick sensed 
it. So did Poet. <unk> like a cat, he leaped back, <unk> up the 
spring gun and, <unk> pointed it toward the <unk> At the same <unk> Nick hit the barrel and threw himself upon the smaller man. 
The gun fired next to his ear with a vicious <unk> like the first stroke 
of an old steam <unk> At the same instant, Elaine screamed <unk> 
the sound ending abruptly as Nick went off the boat and into the 
water on top of the <unk> struggling Poet.   The moment the 
sea closed over <unk> some <unk> sense warned him that he would <unk> in this alien element only if he did not <unk> But the murderer 
to whom he clung had a tremendous advantage. The wide <unk> 
on <unk> feet gave his legs incredible power, driving the two of them 
down into the water as they rolled over and over. Poet was the <unk> 
arms <unk> to his side, and he twisted <unk> trying 
to escape. Poet would <unk> Nick thought <unk> because he wore the <unk> which would keep him alive under water. But Nick would 
not let go.   The rubber and glass face mask slipped from <unk> <unk> bounced <unk> off <unk> <unk> then disappeared. <unk> twisted again and <unk> <unk> scraped on the air <unk> <unk> 
off the <unk> For a split second, Nick relaxed his grip and <unk> <unk> body spun completely around before Nick could stop 
him, holding him now from the rear. Something <unk> at the side of <unk> head as they rolled around and around.   Suddenly Poet 
stopped struggling and the two of them hung suspended in the water, 
not <unk> not <unk> A sharp pain <unk> across <unk> chest and 
a bubble of air escaped from his tortured <unk> joining dozens of 
others that sailed <unk> toward the surface like helium <unk> rising 
into the sky. A black, <unk> object swayed <unk> in front of 
him, <unk> bubbles from its flat <unk> head. The air hose was <unk> 
The discovery struck Nick like a <unk>   <unk> Nick <unk> one hand up, catching <unk> neck in the bend of his <unk> 
At the same instant, he grabbed the <unk> <unk> hose with his 
other hand and bit down on the hard rubber <unk> <unk> 
he <unk> through his nose then <unk> in the air from the <unk> At 
once the <unk> pain in his chest stopped and he was seized with 
a <unk> wild <unk>   As if this was a <unk> Poet abruptly 
began to <unk> the water and the quick movement slowly made them <unk> through the water. <unk> Nick held on, sucking on the <unk> <unk> the air that belonged to Poet. Poet was not fighting <unk> <unk> <unk> sticks out into the ocean like the fat neck 
of a <unk> <unk> It's a rich village but not much for <unk> too 
many solid <unk> not enough tourists or working <unk> It's 
at the far end of the county and the last time I came here was for 
a hit and run <unk> about seven months ago.   Chief Bob <unk> looked his same <unk> a man mountain running to <unk>

The Hotel <unk> proved to be one of the 
older hotels in Pearson City, and definitely <unk> <unk> 
first impression of the lobby was <unk> Victorian <unk> black <unk> and red <unk> a black and white <unk> floor, and Persian <unk> studied the night clerk as a man measures an <unk> <unk> like the room I had the last time".   <unk> <unk> The clerk was young and <unk> with a tired smile.

went to a chart of guest names and room numbers hanging on the wall 
behind the <unk> <unk> the number <unk> stood one <unk> <unk> <unk> glance followed <unk> "We have

At the same <unk> face was dark, <unk> and <unk> 
He always looked <unk> and he could look <unk> He was 
looking dangerous now. He raised his voice. "Anything wrong with 
the <unk> in <unk>   There was a sudden stillness in the <unk> Two women, who had been <unk> like <unk> were struck <unk> A man, lighting a match for his <unk> paused until the flame <unk> his fingers. Even the <unk> on their bench were <unk> <unk> eyes <unk> "Of course <unk> <unk> with a <unk> disease been in there"?   <unk> 
The clerk was almost <unk> "It's just that- well, <unk> is being <unk>   "I don't believe it". Alec <unk> on the desk, holding the <unk> eyes with his. <unk> 
you tell me the real <unk> he <unk> "There might be a story

to <unk>   The stillness persisted as Alec followed 
a <unk> across the lobby to the <unk> He could feel eyes on his 
back. He wished it had not been necessary to announce the number of 
his suite quite so <unk>   The corridor on the <unk> floor 
was dimly lighted by electric <unk> at intervals of thirty feet. A <unk> <unk> carpet muffled every <unk> At the end of the corridor <unk> noticed a door <unk> <unk> <unk> It was a neat <unk> for murder.   The <unk> unlocked a white door numbered <unk> The room was dark but a neon sign flashed and faded beyond the <unk> A few <unk> <unk> down through that theatrical red <unk> <unk> as falling <unk> <unk> the boy switched on a ceiling <unk>   The room looked normal and even <unk> There was 
no hint of a violent struggle now. Deal furniture with a mahogany finish 
was neatly arranged as if it stood in the window of a department <unk> The blue rug was <unk> bright and new. It had never been <unk> with blood. Table covers and towels were clean, <unk> 
empty and supplied with fresh <unk> The mirror over the bureau was 
a blank eye, round and <unk>   Alec played the part of an innocent <unk> "Is there anything wrong with this <unk> The boy dropped his eyes.   <unk> you'll 
lose your job if you don't keep your mouth <unk>   The boy 
raised his eyes. "Listen, <unk> If you want my advice, pack up

not talking. But I wouldn't spend a night in here for a million <unk>   He was in a hurry to get out of the room. Alec 
gave him a tip and let him go.   <unk> Alec examined the doors. 
There were <unk> one leading to a <unk> one to the hall, and 
one to the room next door which was <unk> locked or bolted on 
the other side. Alec locked the hall door and put the key with his 
watch on the <unk> table. It was just quarter of <unk>   As 
he ranged his <unk> on the bureau he noticed a film of white dust 
on the dark surface of the wood beyond the <unk> cover. Not gray like 
the dust that collects in an <unk> room, but white. <unk> didn't 
use white face powder <unk> he <unk> They used pink, <unk> or <unk> powder.   Alec glanced into the bathroom. <unk> in the <unk> where the murderer appears to have washed his <unk> 
It seemed 
clean now, but Alec decided against a bath. He crawled into bed and <unk> off the light.   In the darkness he could see the rosy <unk> of the neon sign on the wall opposite the window. It winked 
as steadily as a <unk> on, <unk> on, off. In less than 
five minutes <unk> was asleep.   He never knew just what woke him. Yet 
suddenly he was <unk> There was no sound and apparently no movement 
in the room except the <unk> <unk> of the red light on 
the wall.   He lay still, listening to the silence, watching the <unk> Somewhere in the city a big clock sounded twelve solemn <unk> <unk> <unk> to the medical examiner she was shot between 
eleven p&m& and one <unk> <unk> heard a faint sound. 
His heart seemed to <unk> and knock against the wall of his chest. 
For the sound was inside the room.   he let his <unk> <unk> 
and breathed heavily, <unk> sleep. The sound was coming <unk> A <unk> shadow fell across the illuminated wall, distorted and <unk> the neon sign faded out, the shadow disappeared. 
When the neon sign flashed on, the shadow was still there. It stretched 
to an impossible <unk> climbing the wall to the ceiling. That 
meant that something between the light and its reflection on the wall 
was moving closer to the source of the <unk> in this case, the <unk> Alec <unk> his <unk> ready to <unk> The <unk> <unk> him with a <unk> The shadow <unk> Someone 
had moved beyond the range of the light from the window.   <unk> <unk> Alec leaped out of bed and groped for the light switch. 
Before he could snap it on, a <unk> blow caught him in the <unk> 
He <unk> out blindly with his right. There was a thick, <unk> crack 
of fist on flesh.   Something hard <unk> his <unk> He 
put everything he had into the next and aimed down where the stomach ought 
to be. <unk> cloth <unk> his <unk> There was a <unk> curiously <unk> like that of an animal in pain. Something heavy shook 
the floor as it <unk>   Alec waited a moment, on guard. Nothing <unk> Again he groped for the light switch.   The blue <unk> had been rolled up and stacked in one corner of the room. On the <unk> <unk> a man lay face down. He had a short, heavy, powerful 
body.   Alec turned him over and discovered a round, <unk> face 
with narrow, <unk> <unk> a primitive <unk> face from Russia 
or the <unk> The man's shoes were too <unk> his <unk> too 
broad at the shoulders and too narrow at the <unk>   There was 
a slight <unk> under the left <unk> a shoulder <unk> Alec promptly <unk> the gun. He was familiar with this type. He had seen it 
in the <unk> at Police Headquarters in New York, in Broadway night <unk> and Seventh Avenue pool rooms, in the criminal <unk> But 
he was surprised to meet it here. Diana <unk> had no connection 
with the <unk>   A professional <unk> would not have killed 
her with a weapon of such small caliber as a <unk> Nor would he <unk> a respectable hotel as the scene for a killing when it would be 
so much <unk> to take his victim for a <unk> ride on a lonely country <unk>   The man's <unk> <unk> He opened his <unk> are you doing here"? demanded <unk>   The man 
made no reply. His eyes were <unk> His lips were <unk> and swollen 
where Alec had hit him.   "Did you kill Diana <unk> expected an indignant <unk> but there was no response 
at all.   "Oh, come on, snap out of it! Or I'll turn 
you over to the <unk> The silence was getting on <unk> <unk>   The man opened his mouth, but no words came. Only that <unk> animal <unk> Alec had heard during their fight. <unk> you speak <unk>   The man opened his mouth <unk> A <unk> pointed toward his <unk> Alec leaned forward to <unk> There were hideous scars inside the throat and the <unk> was <unk> 
In good time I shall get to the distressing <unk> to Red <unk> 
and Handley Walker, to murder and sudden death. But you <unk> 
I am sure, how much old deeds <unk> to new ones, and you must forgive 
me if I tell you first of the old ones.   It was in <unk> that <unk> <unk> and his sister sat by a meager fire in their house 
on Dogtown <unk> a <unk> place even then. He was <unk> his <unk> <unk> said he "do you think people who commit <unk> 
go to <unk> and she answered, "I don't know, but I hope 
you'll never do such a thing". Without a <unk> "God <unk> 
he said, and went out and cut his throat in the cave near <unk> <unk> <unk>   What has this to do with the <unk> <unk> 
I assure you. You must know what gets into people, even such as 
Red and <unk> before you can tell what comes out of them. They 
had learned, both of them, about Abraham <unk> That's why I <unk> 
you not to forget him. His ghost is not <unk> Red and <unk> God 
help them, knew the old Dogtown <unk> and I knew they knew it, for 
I'd told them a lot of it. And isn't it true that you get a deeper <unk> about a man and his motives when you know what it is 
he <unk>   Yes, <unk> I am getting to the point, to my <unk> You know the <unk> they are set forth in your own newspapers. 
You want from me the story, but a story is about <unk> and then, 
perhaps, about <unk> The <unk> you <unk> yesterday morning. 
So what I am trying to tell you is the <unk> that is <unk> <unk> and that concerns the spirit of the matter. There is an <unk> and a <unk> to old furniture <unk> at that mahogany <unk> 
behind <unk> which has a provocative <unk> if I may say so. <unk> 
too, have their haunting <unk> Even people. And my point 
in this sad story is the spirit of the matter. When you hold the spirit 
of a thing, then somehow you know the <unk> you know a fake antique 
from the real thing. And the truth is what you've come for, is 
it not?   Now, Dogtown is one of those places that <unk> into 
the <unk> as <unk> get into old wood, under the <unk> In fact, 
all the folk who lived on the back of Cape <unk> they are not just like <unk> There's a different <unk> on them. There were no <unk> <unk> here because everyone had a <unk> in the family. Just think 
of old <unk> <unk> who pulled the teeth of Dark <unk> <unk> real name was <unk> and because he <unk> the job and left 
two <unk> <unk> she put such a <unk> on him that he thought his legs 
were made of glass. After that he was never known to run or even walk <unk> Today Dogtown is the only deserted village in all New England 
that I know of. There it <unk> a small <unk> with towns like <unk> near <unk> but now it's the most lost and tortured place 
in the world. Those who lived in that <unk> of rocky <unk> 
took on some of the <unk> <unk> character. <unk> say it 
is the last <unk> of a great <unk> but one rather feels that only 
a <unk> giant could have piled up those <unk> <unk> of <unk> 
which still seem to preserve a sort of <unk> ominous life 
in them.   We'll walk up there later. It's perhaps a mile from 
here where we <unk> And not one single dwelling left there, though <unk> in the early eighteenth century, there were close to a hundred <unk> (I myself have identified about sixty <unk> from the old maps 
and <unk> A fascinating <unk> I assure <unk> Even I can 
remember nothing but ruined <unk> and tumbled <unk> and nobody has 
lived there in the memory of any living man. It is now a sweep of <unk> 
and <unk> with <unk> <unk> and <unk> creeping across the <unk> 
and everywhere the <unk> and the long, long <unk>   That's 
your <unk> and a sinister one. <unk> get that in your reports. 
It accounts for so many things. Both Red <unk> and Handley Walker 
lived nearby, almost as near as I do. Red lived at <unk> 
and from his house he could be up on the Common in a half <unk> <unk> <unk> Handley lived further on, at <unk> <unk> I'd often 
find one or other of them up around Dogtown <unk> They were 
both <unk> <unk> <unk> They <unk> What should one <unk> Well, <unk> Dogtown Common is so much off the beaten track nowadays 
that only Sunday <unk> still stray up there, from time to 
time. <unk> <unk> lack of water, killed <unk> <unk> dead 
as a brass door <unk> and I sometimes feel like the <unk> for I'm 
about the last to be even <unk>   I knew Red and Handley 
well. As I said, they were both <unk> They'd come, <unk> 
to <unk> some twenty years <unk> there's always been an <unk> colony somewhere on Cape <unk> and each married here. 
They married <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> There are a lot of <unk> in this neck of the <unk> and many still make painted 
furniture and take <unk> <unk> girls among them, with blonde <unk> and <unk> faces. Handley married <unk> and <unk> of the red beard, 
married <unk> And it was because of an old <unk> <unk> that 
I got to understand them all so well. The quarrel ended in a ridiculous <unk> but I must tell you about it. Oh, yes, I'm quite sure 
it's important, because of the <unk> <unk> What's that? <unk> that's what gave me the feeling, gave me <unk> the spirit, 
the <unk> evil spirit of this whole <unk>   You see, besides 
being <unk> of <unk> I am also <unk> No, I don't <unk> with those who live entirely among dead things. I know as 
well as the next man that a ship is called from the <unk> she <unk> 
where the live wind <unk> and not from the <unk> But you've got 
to know both. What's below the <unk> interests me also. As I 
was saying, I've known all about the old records, including the old <unk> <unk> Some ten years ago that page was torn out, I don't 
know by <unk> About five years ago, Handley came to ask me if he 
could see the <unk> <unk> He was <unk> and casual about it, 
as though it were of no <unk> He's always like that, in spite 
of being a big man. <unk> you see him, you'll notice his habit 
of <unk> I might almost say, <unk> a large <unk> with black hairs 
on it, by his right <unk> A <unk> man, but very <unk> some 
would say <unk> Like his <unk> black hair. Too many outside <unk> 
to my taste. He is the sort who, with an <unk> eye, would <unk> the street to help a strange woman on to a bus and then <unk> her. 
A real gentleman, I <unk> would do neither. He's always worn 
a <unk> hat, and I've <unk> in my small study at the Society, 
that he rather smells of <unk> The next week, cousin Red <unk> in as <unk> but <unk> and <unk> Red was small and <unk> 
like <unk> He too asked to see the same <unk> When I 
told him someone had torn it out, he shouted. "By God, it's that <unk> <unk> the <unk> And later in the same week they both 
came together to examine the <unk> <unk> we were alone in 
the <unk> so few people nowadays are interested even in their own 
past or in the lovely craft of other <unk> for they began to abuse 
each other in the <unk> language. Red thrusting out his <unk> beard, <unk> <unk> under his suddenly <unk> black hair. They actually <unk> <unk> <unk> et <unk> <unk> <unk> men both. Red always 
was <unk> yet that day the <unk> Handley was the <unk> of the <unk> But for my <unk> they would have been at each <unk> <unk> the quarrel I learned what the trouble was, from 
the <unk> each <unk> at the other. The <unk> <unk> had 
suddenly 
become <unk> There's a fine <unk> <unk> there, and <unk> 
coming back for public buildings. Both men knew it was in the <unk> family <unk> but to which of the cousins did it <unk> <unk> or <unk> Fortunately, I knew almost exactly what the will 
had said. It began with a <unk> of course. This explained that the <unk> of <unk> of Essex County, <unk> or <unk> appointed three <unk> 
of <unk> to divide and establish the <unk> <unk> 
After the usual <unk> <unk> it went on to say that there had 
been set off to the widow one full third part of the real estate of 
the <unk> <unk> <unk> one lower room, on the Western side, privileges 
to the well and <unk> and to one third of the cellar (I

they set off to the widow her own land that she brought with her as <unk> namely the <unk> <unk> And I remember that the whole of 
the <unk> not counting the <unk> <unk> was valued at twenty <unk> I wish you could have seen the <unk> fall on these two <unk> <unk> when I told them that obviously the pasture belonged 
to their wives <unk>   That battle scene, ridiculous at it was, 
remained in my mind. A disturbing picture of bad blood, to be further <unk> with <unk> if <unk> colors, for on a subsequent day 
I saw Handley <unk> <unk> <unk> wife, up on Dogtown <unk> 
I felt it would be <unk> to <unk> my <unk> Not that 
I <unk> go <unk> but the <unk> up there are very high 
and I am a small <unk> other cause of <unk> between them 
I must tell you. <unk> <unk> and <unk> as Red <unk> was, 
he was much the better <unk> I suppose Handley knew it. If Red 
had a show at <unk> Handley would hurry to hang his pictures in <unk> You may say this has little <unk> but, <unk> 
remember that all this prepared my mind, <unk> my intelligence. By 
such touches the pattern takes <unk> You would call these the motives 
of <unk> I would call them the patterns of life, perhaps even the <unk> of <unk> Yet with all this knowledge I had nothing of substance 
to <unk> our case, as you would call it, till <unk> month ago, on the 20th of October, was the opening of the <unk> <unk> in Massachusetts. Not much to <unk> but there are a few <unk> <unk> too, if you care for them, which most of the folk 
around here haven't the sense to <unk> Any more than they have 
the sense to eat <unk> That was the day Red was said to have 
gone away. <unk> yes, he'd talked about doing so. In fact, he often <unk> 
from time to <unk> off to paint the sea, aboard a <unk> 
out from <unk> <unk> his wife, never seemed to mind. I suppose 
these <unk> gave her more <unk> for her <unk> with Cousin <unk> <unk> I wasn't surprised, early that morning, to see <unk> himself crossing from Dogtown Common Road to the Back <unk> No, he didn't have his gun, which he should have. It would 
have been a good excuse for his being there at all. I myself had been 
up there by seven <unk> after <unk> since <unk> been a 
week of rain which had stopped early that morning and the day was as clear 
as <unk> <unk> what the man had said. Haney peered <unk> at his <unk> companion through <unk> <unk> eyes. He had no ready <unk> as much from surprise as from the fit of <unk> Was the 
man drunk or crazy or <unk> But his <unk> <unk> had matched him <unk> for drink until he lost count, and the man's eyes were still <unk>   <The guy is off his <unk> Haney thought to himself, 
and looked away from those eyes. Eyes that were clear, but also bright 
with a strange intensity, a sort of cold fire burning behind them. 
Why hadn't he noticed it <unk> No, the man was not drunk <unk> wondered how he got tied up with this stranger. But, of course, 
he remembered now. It was <unk> after two hours of steady drinking, 
but the occasion of it came back to him. The stranger, his head <unk> sunk in thought, started to cross the street against the 
light just as a huge moving van roared through the <unk> <unk> and a horn <unk> <unk> but the man would have 
been hit if Phil hadn't called out to him a second before. His <unk> 
had been <unk> something anybody might have done without thinking, 
on the spur of the moment. As a matter of fact, he wouldn't 
have cared at all if the guy had been hit. Actually, he regretted having 
opened his mouth when the truck came to a stop and the angry driver <unk> down from the cab and walked back toward them.   By then, 
the stranger was <unk> Haney <unk> and had one arm around his <unk> as if he were an old friend. So the driver started to curse 
at both of them as if they had been in a plot together to ruin his <unk> record.   Then the man he saved turned and looked <unk> into the truck <unk> face, without saying a word. Very <unk> the driver stopped <unk> at them, turned on his heel and 
went back to his truck.   Haney hadn't given it much thought at 
the time. Now he recalled it very <unk> and wondered what the truck <unk> had seen in those eyes to make him back off. It must have 
been the sort of look that can call a <unk> without saying a <unk> the light went their way, they went on across the street. And 
when the stranger found out that Phil was on the way to one of his <unk> <unk> he insisted on offering to buy drinks for both of <unk> usually went alone and kept to himself, sitting in a corner 
and passing the time by nursing his favorite <unk> But he decided 
he wouldn't mind company in return for free <unk> even though 
he made good money at his job. Phil was like that. <unk> 
he wondered 
if it was worth it, having a <unk> for company. He really 
didn't take the offer <unk> but he began to feel <unk> When 
he finally got the <unk> under control, he realized that Pete <unk> 
he gave was his first <unk> was still waiting for an <unk> he didn't 
even seem to <unk> as he continued to <unk>   Haney managed 
a weak <unk> <unk> I can't think of anyone, <unk> Thanks <unk> faint <unk> appeared between the man's <unk> 
"I think you aren't taking me <unk> Phil. I meant it. And 
everybody has some kind of <unk> I might have got hit by that truck 
if it wasn't for you. I believe in returning <unk> I'll do 
anything for somebody I like. It won't cost you a cent, Phil. Go <unk> and try <unk>   Phil rubbed his forehead <unk> He 
was beginning to feel <unk> Maybe it would be better to humor the <unk> and then make an <unk> He really didn't expect anything to come 
of it, and there <unk> a few people **h   "All right", 
he <unk> finally, "if you must know, I don't get along with the <unk> He keeps riding me because I like to listen to the radio 
and sing while I'm taking a bath. He says the neighbors <unk> 
but I don't believe it. Why don't they tell me themselves if it <unk> <unk>   The man closed his eyes and nodded. When he 
looked up again, he <unk> almost <unk> <unk> Give me your <unk> It will take a little time. I want to study your <unk> <unk> and movements first. You see, I always make it look like 
an <unk> Maybe <unk> if it looks reasonable. In that way there's 
no trouble for the <unk>   <unk> eyebrows flew 
up. <unk>   Pete smiled <unk> "It's my 
line of <unk> he said **h   Five minutes later, before Haney 
could make his <unk> the stranger stood up and nodded <unk> Haney 
watched the small but <unk> man slip out the door quickly and <unk> 
and felt relieved to see that nobody else seemed to notice his <unk> decided to stay a little longer, and as time passed 
it seemed as if the strange little man had never been there, but for 
the other glass on the table. Some time before midnight he returned 
to his apartment and hit the <unk> putting the whole incident out of 
mind before he fell asleep.   The next day, Sunday, the <unk> 
reminded Haney where he had been the night before. The <unk> 
in turn reminded him of his conversation with the <unk> and he <unk> He went for more <unk> later in the day, and passed the <unk> <unk> on the way- he was still alive and <unk> as usual, 
as if <unk> were a burden in his life. Phil shrugged and ignored <unk> went back to work Monday. By Wednesday the landlord was 
still alive. Of course **h On Thursday, Haney mailed the monthly 
check for separate maintenance to his wife <unk> and wished the stranger 
could do something about her **h   <unk> home from work, 
he was startled to see a police car parked in front of the apartment <unk> Inside the <unk> people were standing around, talking <unk> 
His <unk> crawled with a <unk> <unk> as he asked one 
of his fellow <unk> what had happened.   The landlord had died. <unk> that afternoon, it seemed, he had fallen off the roof while 
on some obscure <unk> or <unk> He had apparently been alone. Nobody <unk> the <unk> just the <unk> impact when his body smashed 
on the <unk> just outside the basement delivery <unk> hoped that nobody noticed his sudden <unk> as he felt the 
blood drain from his <unk> He muttered something about how terrible 
it was, and walked with deliberate <unk> to the <unk> Once 
inside his apartment, he poured a drink with trembling hands and flopped <unk> in a chair.   After a while he began to feel better about 
it, especially when no one bothered to ask any questions. But after 
all, why should <unk> Still later, he finally convinced himself 
that it <was> an <unk> just a <unk> The stranger really 
had nothing to do with it, of course **h   Haney went to bed, 
happy that at least he was rid of that <unk> <unk> After all, the 
man had no family, so no one <unk> and everybody was better off 
for it. <unk> he said to himself, nobody kills a man just as a <unk> you thought I didn't mean what I <unk> The <unk> 
eyes were large and <unk> as if Phil Haney had hurt his <unk> 
It was like a <unk> <unk> dream, but now the dream was 
beginning to take on <unk> of a <unk>   However, Haney 
knew it was not a dream. He might be very <unk> but he knew where 
he was. It was the same bar, and it was two weeks <unk> Saturday 
night, when he had an excuse to drink heavier than usual. <unk> 
had been sitting in the usual corner at the little table, as far as possible 
from any <unk> friendly <unk> He was enjoying the weekly <unk> of washing down his pet <unk> with <unk> slightly <unk> 
with water. This favorite <unk> was not the <unk> He had 
already quite forgotten about him. In fact, he had only mentioned him 
on the spur of the moment. His real <unk> was <unk>   <unk> 
the end of his fourth <unk> <unk> while he was <unk> making <unk> <unk> on the <unk> with the bottom of the glass, he became 
aware that he was not alone. He looked up with <unk> eyes and <unk> 
the stranger sitting across the table, smiling a secret smile at him, 
as if they were fellow <unk> He hadn't even <unk> 
what was his <unk> <unk> he hadn't seen him sit down. The man 
was <unk> like a <unk> and made as much noise as a <unk> felt like <unk> out of sight, but he was already trapped 
in the corner with the <unk> dark little man. He began to wish that 
he hadn't shouted that other evening when the truck bore down through 
the <unk> Was he going to be <unk> from now on with a creep 
for a <unk> He'd have to start going to some of the other places 
again.   In a low voice, almost <unk> the man had asked <unk> if he was happy with the way the landlord had been taken off 
his back. He made the mistake of answering in an <unk> way, and instantly 
realized that his <unk> must have showed in his face or <unk> <unk> slightly, then became sad and <unk> Haney 
didn't want to encourage his company, but felt he ought to buy him a <unk> <unk> to prevent possible trouble. But there was no trouble. 
The guy <unk> over his drink, obviously upset by <unk> lack of <unk>   To break the uncomfortable silence, Haney began 
to talk. In time, and two drinks later, he was <unk> bitterly 
about his wife, He was on the subject for ten minutes or so when he <unk> the renewed interest in his <unk> it showed in the alert 
face and the suddenly bright eyes.   When he paused to <unk> 
his throat, the stranger broke in. "But why pay her <unk> If she <unk> around with other men, and if you hate her as you say, why not 
just divorce <unk>   Haney <unk> "That <unk> would love 
a <unk> he <unk> "Then she'd get half of everything I <unk> Community property <unk> you know. I'd have to sell out 
my business to pay her off with her share. She can drop <unk> nodded <unk> "Oh yes. Now I see. You must <unk> I haven't been in this state too long. I came out here 
to <unk> That's why <unk> why I do a free job now and then. You 
should have told me about her <unk>   Haney felt a <unk> 
of <unk> when he heard the now familiar line again. Then a wild 
thought ran circles through his <unk> brain. <unk> just suppose 
this guy was really what he said he <unk> A retired professional killer 
**h If he was just a <unk> no harm was done. But if he was the 
real thing, he could do something about <unk> He felt very <unk> 
very proud of himself as he played on the other man's soft <unk> <unk> <unk> he said <unk> "But it's just that- 
well, you know. The cops didn't suspect a thing, and I thought 
it was a <unk> After all, I didn't know you, <unk> It <unk> have been an <unk> He shrugged <unk> "But if 
you say you managed it **h" The stranger was <unk> His eyes burned <unk> "Yes, <unk> he muttered <unk> "Of course 
it looked like an <unk> I always work it that way- and always 
at a time when the customer has an <unk> Let me prove it, Phil. I 
think I can manage one more favor for you". He waited <unk> <unk> the liquor in the bottom of his glass. 
About halfway back Pops groped against a wall and stopped, pulled away 
two loosely nailed wide boards at one end, and went through. <unk> 
he <unk> <unk> <unk> about three feet down, so 
don't <unk> I went through and down, into pitch darkness. He said, <unk> stay still. I'll pull the boards back and then get us 
a light. <unk> stay where you <unk> I <unk> stayed where I was while 
he <unk> around and then walked away. A moment later he struck a <unk> and lighted a <unk> and I could see.   It was a big room, 
empty except for a few things of <unk> at the far <unk> a wooden <unk> on which stood the <unk> a spread out <unk> and an <unk> <unk> I looked back over my shoulder while I went to join him; 
he'd hung another half of a blanket over the boarded window so no 
light would show through.   I took the pint bottle from my pocket 
and handed it over as I sat down beside him on the spread <unk> 
"You <unk> I said.   He drank and handed it back. <unk> <unk> I told him. "Listen, I got a <unk> I travel with, 
real nice guy named <unk> I know where he is, right near here. Could 
he join the party and sleep here tonight <unk> We'll both be blowing 
town tomorrow so we won't be moving in on you".   He hesitated 
a second, looking at the bottle, before he said <unk> 
and I <unk> him. "He'll bring a bottle too, and I'll 
get another one or maybe two while I'm out. You can work on this 
one while I'm gone, kill it if you <unk> I took a short swallow 
from it myself and handed it to him.   His <unk> was <unk> this time. He put the bottle down. <unk> over by the window 
while there's light, an' I'll put <unk> candle out. When <unk> come back I'll put it out <unk> till you're both <unk> was <unk> leaning against a building front. <unk> <unk> I told him. "But we got to go back to Fifth and get 
another bottle or two. On the way I'll give you the <unk> the way I gave him the <unk> I bought another pint of <unk> 
and when we got back Pops let us in in the dark, put back the blanket 
and then lighted the candle again. I introduced my friend <unk> 
to Pops and we made ourselves comfortable. There was still a little, 
not much, left in the first bottle and we passed it around once and <unk> it, and Charlie opened his.   I was <unk> <unk> 
by a poem of Kenneth <unk> called <The <unk> of Two Men 
by a Young <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which Patchen himself 
read on a record against jazz background. The poem consisted of 
only two words, the word <unk> repeated over and over at <unk> <unk> and with different <unk> and then the word <unk> 
and a <unk> final <unk> from the jazz group.   This was 
the same, except that it was the murder of one man by two men and neither 
of us was wearing <unk> But we could wait all <unk> there 
was no <unk> I said, "Wait **h <unk> to Charlie and he grinned, <unk> the <unk> We'd heard the record together <unk> second bottle passed a few times. <unk> was taking long ones, but 
not showing the effect yet. He seemed as drunk as when I'd first 
talked to him, but no <unk> He had a <unk> if we'd really 
been trying to get him dead drunk we'd have had to go out for more <unk>   About halfway through the second bottle, Charlie looked 
at me across <unk> who was sitting between us and asked <unk> 
I said, <unk> and handed the bottle to Pops for his final <unk> When he handed it back and I had hold of it <unk> Pops was 
looking toward me and I said <unk> to Charlie and he swung 
the short length of lead pipe he'd meanwhile taken from his pocket, <unk> It was a lead pipe <unk>   There was a sound like the one 
you produce by <unk> a <unk> with your <unk> only <unk> 
and Pops fell forward from the <unk> and then over <unk> Out cold, 
if not <unk> and he'd never known what hit him- he'd never 
known that <unk> had hit him.   I reached my hand toward 
him to put it inside his shirt to feel for a <unk> but Charlie 
said <unk> and said it <unk> not as in the Patchen bit, 
but as an <unk> so I stopped my hand and looked at him. He was 
holding the piece of lead pipe out to me.   "We don't want to 
know whether he's dead, yet. I <unk> that blow to be <unk> 
To <unk> him and maybe or maybe not <unk> You hit again about twice 
that hard before we know whether he's dead or not. That way we'll 
never know which of us really killed him and which was just the <unk> <unk>   I dug him, I saw his <unk> it made sense. 
I took the piece of pipe from <unk> hand and used it, harder 
than he had. The <unk> was <unk> anyway, and I thought I heard 
bone <unk>   Charlie said, "Good boy. That did it, if mine <unk> And we'll never know <unk> All right, now I'll give 
you a <unk>   We straightened Pops up and I made sure there 
was no trace of a <unk>   I nodded to <unk> "Let's 
put him down again the way he was. It's a more natural <unk> 
We did that.   "How do you <unk> Charlie asked <unk> I told him. "What do you <unk>   <unk> <unk> **h maybe I'm <unk> It was a <unk> but not 
a big enough one for me to want to take the chance again, except for <unk> But let's not talk about it <unk> until we're out of <unk> Now, first question: the <unk> Shall we take them all with 
us, or leave <unk>   "Take them", I said. "If we 
left one we'd have to wipe it for <unk> Here's the picture 
we want to leave for the <unk> whenever the body gets found. This 
happened in the middle of a drinking <unk> with another <unk> If they'd 
been working on a bottle or a <unk> he'd have taken it with <unk> And he'd have taken the weapon with him too, so 
we take that. <unk> He looked around. "I've been careful 
about <unk> How about you"?   <unk> There are 
the boards over the window, of course, but they're not painted and too <unk> to take <unk> <unk> goes for the rough <unk> of the <unk> <unk> I doubt if the cops will even try <unk> They find dead <unk> every day, maybe they won't even <unk> him for the cause of <unk>   "We can't take a chance on that. We've got to 
assume they'll decide he was murdered and we've got to keep the 
picture <unk> Our hypothetical other <unk> who killed him would have 
turned out his <unk> Let's do that". We did that and found 
a dirty <unk> some matches and fourteen cents in change. We 
took the <unk> they were book matches and once they'd been touched 
might retain <unk> and the change.   We discussed 
the candle and decided the hypothetical other <unk> would have left it 
burning to light his way to the window and because he'd have no reason 
to blow it out. The candle had been stuck on a tin lid so it wouldn't 
set fire to the <unk> when it <unk> out. A fire wouldn't have <unk> except that it would cause Pops to be found <unk> He 
might not be found for days, even weeks, otherwise.   We went once 
more over every point, then <unk> Being picked up for questioning 
by a cop on the way out seemed to be the only possible remaining <unk> and we weren't picked up by a <unk> In fact, nobody saw 
us, cop or <unk> <unk> is a quiet street with no <unk> and was <unk> deserted at that hour. <unk> if it matters, was one <unk> <unk> than three hours ago we'd decided, in <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> to commit a trial murder. It had gone like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I found myself thinking, and then told <unk> that was <unk> How safe is too <unk> <unk> like that 
can get you into a <unk> <unk>   An hour later we were back 
in my <unk> <unk> killing what had been left of the second <unk> We 
decided to leave the third one intact for tomorrow. Also our plans for 
me to commit <unk> murder and for him to commit mine. But we 
were really going to do it. We shook hands on it.   We planned <unk> only one step, a rendezvous for tomorrow when we could <unk> notes. 
I'd tell him everything I'd learned about <unk> habits 
and <unk> and he'd tell me the score on <unk> We made the date 
for two o'clock in the afternoon at <unk> <unk> <unk> Charlie 
would get there early because he had the key. From here on in, the 
less Charlie and I were seen together in public, or visited one another's <unk> the better.   I was dead tired and slept <unk> 
as far as I know <unk>   We met at <unk> and decided 
we were set to stay as long as it <unk> into or even through the <unk> to talk things out. Charlie had brought food and we'd decided 
on no <unk> I'd brought along the <unk> pint from last night, 
but we were going to kill that only when we were through <unk> talked first, telling him everything I knew about <unk> and 
his house and domestic <unk> I drew diagrams and floor <unk> 
he <unk> them thoroughly and then we tore them into tiny pieces 
and <unk> them down. He gave me equivalent and even more detailed <unk> on <unk> including <unk> one of the apartment building <unk> lived in and one of the apartment itself. He'd been there several <unk> back when, while he and <unk> had been friends, or at least 
not <unk>   It didn't take us as long as we'd thought 
it <unk> it was not quite six o'clock when we finished and Charlie 
said, "Well, I guess that's it. Shall we <unk> a coin to see 
which of us goes <unk> Or would you rather deal a hand of <unk> <unk> or play a game of gin <unk> or what"?   "Wait a <unk> <unk> I said. "One thing we haven't <unk> expense <unk> We'll need <unk> at least, if only bus fare to the 
scene of the <unk> And if you're as flat broke as I <unk> I think <unk> have to take the added risk of <unk> over a filling station 
or something before we split for one of us to set up an alibi while 
the other does his dirty <unk>   He sighed. "All right, I'll 
come <unk> I've got a little <unk> for a <unk> day, and I <unk> this is <unk> enough. A couple of <unk> If you draw the short <unk> I'll lend you some bread, like fifty <unk> before I take 
off to visit my sister in <unk> Then, after I'm back, another 
fifty so you can put some mileage on yourself and have a solid alibi <unk> while I take care of your seat cover <unk>   <unk> 
I said. I took a deep breath, and the <unk> "In that case, 
let's not <unk> 
I'll go to bat first. You'd have to wait till <unk> 
back from Mexico City and also while I set it up with <unk> 
to have <unk> have an alibi for <unk> So it wouldn't be 
for days or even a week before you could do anything. But your friend <unk> can go any time".   He grinned and <unk> me on the shoulder. 
"I was hoping you'd say that, <unk> But I wouldn't 
have suggested it. <unk> in that case, I take off tomorrow morning 
for <unk> And, in case, I brought the money with <unk> that he knew himself to be self he was free to <unk> ever closer

The word <unk> which turned up over and over again among <unk>

called March. This was no man's land, <unk> by the <unk> 
Union and the <unk> <unk> a potential source of war for 
the last two hundred years. Neither nation would give up their claim 
on it, yet neither wished to make any move that might lead to a second <unk> War. So, for all practical purposes, it was an independent 
nation and by now had its own organized government <unk> 
outside its own <unk> Its citizens spoke all of the world's surviving <unk> plus a new one called <unk> a <unk> whose vocabulary 
was derived from the other six and whose <unk> was so simple it could 
be contained on half a sheet of paper.   Hal saw in his mind 
the rest of <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> Islands, 
and the eastern half of South America. Here the peoples spoke the tongue 
of <unk> because that island had gotten the jump on the <unk> 
who were busy <unk> North America and the western 
half of South America after the <unk> War.   Then 
there was North America, where American was the native speech of all 
except the twenty <unk> of <unk> living on the Hudson <unk> <unk>   Hal knew that when that side of Earth <unk> into the night <unk> <unk> City would <unk> out into space. 
And, somewhere in that enormous light, was his apartment. But Mary 
would soon no longer be living there, for she would be <unk> in a 
few days that her husband had died in an accident while on a flight to <unk> She would <unk> in <unk> he was sure, for she loved him 
in her <unk> way, though in public she would be <unk> Her friends 
and professional associates would sympathize with her, not because she 
had lost a beloved husband, but because she had been married to a man 
who thought <unk> If Hal <unk> had been killed in a <unk> he must have wanted it that way. There was no such thing as an <unk> <unk> all the other passengers <unk> supposed to

and their ashes flung to the winds in public <unk> No, the fish 
could eat their bodies for all the <unk> <unk>   Hal felt <unk> for <unk> he had a time keeping the tears from <unk> to his

he told himself, this was the best way. He and Mary would no longer 
have to tear and <unk> at each <unk> their mutual <unk> would be <unk> Mary was free to marry again, not knowing that the <unk> had <unk> given her a <unk> thinking that death had dissolved her <unk> She would have a year in which to make up her mind, to choose

up at him.   "My beloved ward, my perennial <unk> said the <unk> voice. "I had no idea that you, too, would be on this glorious <unk> But I might have <unk> We seem to be bound by <unk> <unk> himself must have foreseen it.

towards her <unk> and, under <unk> <unk> began to build 
up towards her ultimate <unk> <unk> percent of the speed of light. <unk> all the personnel except those few needed to carry out 
the performance of the ship, went into the <unk> Here they would <unk> in suspended <unk> for many years. Some time later, after 
a check had been made of all automatic equipment, the crew would join 
the others. They would sleep while the <unk> drive would increase 
the acceleration to a point which the <unk> bodies of the personnel 
could not have <unk> Upon reaching the desired speed, the <unk> equipment would cut off the <unk> and the silent but not empty <unk> would <unk> towards the star which was its <unk> <unk> years later, the <unk> apparatus in the nose of 
the ship would determine that the star was close enough to <unk> <unk> <unk> a force too strong for <unk> bodies to endure 
would be <unk> Then, after <unk> the vessel <unk> the drive 
would adjust to a <unk> <unk> And the crew would be automatically 
brought out of their suspended <unk> These members would 
then <unk> the rest of the personnel. And, in the <unk> left 
before reaching their <unk> the men would carry out whatever <unk> were needed.   Hal <unk> was among the last to go 
into the <unk> and among the first to come out. He had to study 
the <unk> of the language of the chief nation of <unk> <unk> 
And, from the first, he faced a difficult task. The expedition that 
had discovered <unk> had succeeded in <unk> two thousand <unk> 
words with an equal number of American words. The description of 
the <unk> <unk> was very <unk> And, as Hal found out, obviously <unk> in many <unk> discovery caused Hal <unk> 
His duty was to write a school text and to teach the entire personnel 
of the <unk> how to speak <unk> Yet, if he used all of the 
little means at his <unk> he would be <unk> his students <unk> Moreover, even getting this across would be <unk> one thing, the organs of speech of the <unk> natives differed 
somewhat from <unk> the sounds made by these organs were, 
therefore, <unk> It was true that they could be <unk> 
but would the <unk> understand these <unk>   Another <unk> was the <unk> construction of <unk> Consider 
the tense system. Instead of <unk> a <unk> or using an <unk> <unk> to indicate the past or future, <unk> used an entirely different <unk> Thus, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
meaning <unk> <unk> was, in the perfect tense, <unk> 
and, in the future, <unk> The same use of 
an entirely different word applied for all the other <unk> <unk> the 
fact that <unk> not only had the normal (to <unk> three <unk> 
of <unk> <unk> and <unk> but the two extra of <unk> and <unk> Fortunately, <unk> was <unk> though the expression 
of it would be difficult for anybody not born in <unk> The system 
of indicating <unk> varied according to <unk>   All the other 
parts of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> under the same system as the <unk> 
This was not, for the <unk> just a matter of running through a logical 
or <unk> <unk> or deciding on some action from some already 
established <unk> No doubt the Angels could do that kind of thing 
as fast as any computer.   What Gabriel was being asked to do 
now, however, was to <unk> all his basic <unk> make <unk> 
on them, and give them new and different powers in his mind 
to govern his <unk> This is not wholly a reasoning <unk> a computer 
cannot do it all- and even in an <unk> it takes time. <unk> 
perhaps, <unk> in an <unk> whose assumptions had mostly been 
fixed millions of years <unk>   Being reasonably sure of the 
reason for the long <unk> however, did not make it seem any less long 
to Jack. He had already become used to <unk> snapping back answers 
to questions almost before Jack could get them asked.   There 
was nothing he could do but wait. The dice were <unk>   At 
last Gabriel <unk>   "We <unk> you", he said slowly. 
"We had concluded that no race as <unk> as yours could have had 
time to develop a sense of justice. Of course we have before us the 
example of the great races at the <unk> <unk> individually they 
are nearly as mortal as <unk> the difference does not seem very marked 
to us, where it exists. But they have survived for long periods <as <unk> whereas you are young. We shall recommend to them that 
they <unk> your trial period by half.   "For now, it is clear 
that we were in the wrong. You may <unk> your property, and the <unk> on <unk> is <unk> <unk> you may <unk>   "I 
did not perceive this essential distinction either, <unk> <unk> said at once, "I was only practicing a concept that Jack <unk> me, called a <unk>   <unk> you were its <unk> Jack, what is the nature of this <unk>   "It's 
a kind of agreement in which each party gives something to the <unk> 
Jack said. "We regard it as fair only when each party feels 
that what he has received is as <unk> or more <unk> than what 
he has <unk> His heart, he discovered, was <unk> "For <unk> <unk> agreed to help me find my property, and I agreed 
to take him to Earth. Between individuals, this process is called <unk> When it is done between races or nations, it is called 
making a <unk> And the major part of my mission to your nest is to 
make a treaty between your race and mine. <unk> the property was 
much less <unk>   <unk> Gabriel said. "And 
apparently impossible. Though it might be that we would have much to 
give you, you have nothing to give us".   <unk> and <unk> 
Jack said, <unk> that we do".   Another <unk> 
but this one was not nearly as long.   "Then it is a matter of <unk> of <unk> of a more alive time. Yes, those could 
be commodities under this <unk> But you should understand, Jack, 
that <unk> and <unk> are not long out of the <unk> <unk> 
the Earth would not be an offering of worth to those of us who are <unk> explained a great deal. "All the more reason, <unk> Jack said, <unk> we must have a <unk> We will <unk> entertain 
your young and give them proper living <unk> in return for 
their help in running our fusion <unk> But we must know if this 
is in accordance with your <unk> and must have your agreement they 
will not <unk> the power we put in their hands, to our <unk> this simply requires that they behave in accordance with the <unk> of their own <unk> and respect yours in turn. To this 
we 
of course <unk>   Jack felt a wave of complete <unk> but 
in a second it had vanished without a <unk> What Gabriel was asking 
was that mankind <unk> all its parochial moral <unk> and contract 
to let the Angels serve on Earth as it is in Heaven <unk> 
of the applicable Earth laws. The Angels in turn would exercise 
similar restraints in respect for the natural <unk> and <unk> 
of the <unk> but they had no <unk> notion of man's <unk> <unk> of passing and <unk> laws which were contrary to his own <unk> and <unk> of his nature.   The simple treaty principle 
that Gabriel was asking him to <unk> in short, was nothing 
less than total <unk>   Nothing less would <unk> And it might <unk> considering the uncomfortable custom the Angels had of thinking 
of everything in terms of <unk> that the proposal of anything less 
might well amount instead to something like a <unk> of <unk> even the highly trained law clerk who was a part of <unk> total <unk> could not understand how the principle could 
ever be <unk> Almost the whole experience of mankind pointed toward <unk> not <unk> as the <unk> and <unk> attitude toward all <unk>   Yet there was some precedent for it. The history of <unk> <unk> for instance, had been <unk> <unk> 
but the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist <unk> <unk> did eventually agree on an atomic bomb test <unk> and 
a sort of provisional acceptance of each other's good intentions on 
this limited question. Out of that <unk> though not by any easy <unk> eventually emerged the present world <unk> of the United <unk> <unk> between member states still <unk> but it was of 
about the same low order of <unk> as the twentieth-century rivalry 
between <unk> and California over water supplies.   Besides, <unk> "in <unk> with the <unk> details to be <unk> 
out later, were commonplace in diplomatic history. The trouble with 
them was that they almost never <unk> and in fact an agreement "in <unk> historically turned out to be a sure sign that neither 
party really wanted the quarrel <unk>   Suppose that this one 
were to <unk> There was no question in Jack's mind of the good 
faith on one side, at <unk> If mankind could be convinced of that <unk> was worth <unk> In fact, it had to be tried. It would 
be at once the most tentative and most final treaty that Earth had 
ever <unk> Secretary Hart had taught Jack, at least <unk> to 
be content with small beginnings in all diplomatic <unk> but there 
was no small way to handle this one.   He turned back to the <unk> the <unk> conclusive phrase on his lips. But he was too late. 
He had lost his audience. <unk> a moment he could make no 
sense at all of what he <unk> It seemed to be only a <unk> of color, light 
and meaningless activity. <unk> he realized that the <unk> 
of <unk> <unk> had <unk> and that the ritual learning dance of 
the nursery had been broken up. The Angels in the nursery were <unk> <unk> in all <unk> seemingly at <unk>   <unk> <unk> going on here? What's <unk>   "Your <unk> have been found. They are on their way here". <unk> I don't see them. The instruments don't show <unk> can't see them yet, Jack. They'll be in range 
in a short <unk>   Jack scanned the <unk> the <unk> and 
the skies again. <unk> <unk> there was a tiny <unk> on the <unk> 
and it was getting bigger rapidly. If that was the <unk> it was making <unk> <unk>   Then the <unk> <unk> into sight, just 
a dot of light at first against the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
of the <unk> <unk> Through the <unk> Jack could see that 
both <unk> were still attached to it. The <unk> was still <unk> 
though there were a good many holes in it, as <unk> had predicted 
would be the case by now.   It was a <unk> almost <unk> <unk> but even more <unk> was the fact that it was trailing an <unk> <unk> of <unk>   The <unk> was not heading 
for the <unk> however. It seemed unlikely that her <unk> if either 
of them were alive, could even see the <unk> for they were passing 
her at a distance of nearly a <unk> And there would be no <unk> of <unk> them- without the <unk> generator Jack could 
not send a call powerful enough to get through all the <unk> and by 
the time he could <unk> his fusion power the <unk> would be <unk> <unk> he watched them pass him. The <unk> ragged 
though it was, still had enough surface to catch some of the ocean of 
power being poured out from the nursery stars. He would never have <unk> 
without seeing it, that the <unk> little vessel could go so <unk>   But where was it <unk> And why was it causing so much <unk> among the <unk> and being followed by so many of <unk> was only one possible answer, but Jack's <unk> 
mind refused to believe it until he had fed the radar plots of the <unk> 
course into the computer. The curve on the card the computer <unk> back at him couldn't be argued with, however.   The <unk> 
was headed for the very center of the <unk> toward that place which, 
Jack knew now, could hold nothing less important than the very core 
of the <unk> life and religion.   It was clear that <unk> 
had at last found a way to attract the <unk> <unk> was equally clear that as of this moment, the treaty was off. <unk> <unk> <unk> WOULD <unk> to be headed off, whether 
he knew where he was going or not. Almost surely he <unk> after all, 
he had had the same set of facts as Jack had had to work from, and 
he was an almost <unk> <unk> man. But not having talked 
to the <unk> he had made a wrong turn in his reasoning somewhere along 
the line. Had he decided, perhaps, that the center of the cloud 
was 
a center of government, instead of a center of life and <unk> it didn't matter now whether he meant to invade the Holy 
of <unk> or was simply headed in that direction by <unk> If 
it was <unk> it was now also <unk> and whether <unk> 
or not, the outcome would be <unk>   Jack crawled under 
the boards and restored the six feet of lead line he had <unk> from 
the <unk> generator switch. When he was back on his feet again 
and about to <unk> the <unk> however, he <unk>   He had 
to have fusion power to catch up with the <unk> and he had to have 
it fast. But fusion power in the <unk> <unk> was what had triggered 
all the trouble in the first <unk> and he already had an <unk> <unk>   <unk>   "I'm 
going to turn my generator back on, as I promised to do. But I can't 
take you to Earth yet. First I've got to <unk> my brothers 
before they get any deeper into trouble. Will you <unk> this, 
or will you <unk> I know it's not part of the <unk> and your <unk> might not like it".   "Nobody else can live in your <unk> while I am in it", <unk> said <unk> "As for my <unk> 
they have already admitted that they were wrong. If because of 
this incident they become angry with Earth, I will not be permitted 
to go there at all. Therefore of course I will <unk>   With 
a <unk> sigh of relief, Jack <unk> the <unk> back in and threw 
the switch. Without an <unk> <unk> the green light that 
meant full fusion power winked on the board. <unk> before, it had 
taken five minutes to-   Of course. <unk> was in there. From 
here on out, the <unk> was going to be hotter than any space <unk> man had ever dreamed of.   But since he had failed to <unk> it, he lost the five minutes <unk> in <unk> an <unk> <unk>   <unk> don't use this <unk> vector <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> his bulk up and supported it on one <unk> He rubbed 
his eyes <unk> with one huge <unk> <unk> <unk> you guys <unk>   <unk> wrong with me that couldn't be <unk> <unk> said. He didn't say what would cure him; he had been <unk> all during the trip what he needed to make him feel like himself. 
His small black eyes darted inside the <unk> oval of his <unk> Ryan <unk>   <unk> 
"Well, let's 
take a <unk> look at the country around <unk> <unk> rolled open on the <unk> A range of <unk> <unk> the <unk> the color of <unk> <unk> Above them, the sky 
was the black of space, or the almost equal black of the winter sky above <unk> seen against <unk> snow. That cold, empty sky was 
full of fire and light. It seemed almost a magnification of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> blown up by some master <unk> fiery <unk> was actually only a belt of minor <unk> 
almost like the <unk> belt in the original <unk> <unk> These <unk> were much <unk> nearly all capable of holding an atmosphere. 
But to the <unk> of scientists, for no known reason not all of 
them did. This would be the fifth <unk> expedition to the <unk> 
of <unk> in three generations. They lay months away from the nearest <unk> star by jump <unk> and no one knew what they were good for, 
although it was felt that they would probably be good for something 
if it could only be <unk> much like the continent of <unk> 
in ancient history.   "How can a planet with so many neighbors 
be so <unk> Ryan asked. He was the captain, so he could 
ask questions like that.   "Some can be lonely in a <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> will we need outside, <unk> <unk> asked.   "No <unk> the captain answered. 
"We can breathe out there, all right. It just won't be easy.

adequate defenses had been found for all basic <unk> He wasn't 
likely to come down with hot <unk> and puzzling <unk> <unk> ignored the ladder down to the planet surface and, with only 
a glance at the <unk> gauge to judge surface <unk> dropped 
to the ground.   It was day, but in the thin atmosphere contrasts 
were sharp between light and <unk> They walked from midnight 
to noon, noon to <unk> and came to the <unk> sprawled on its <unk> <unk> it with a <unk> "Hey, this is pretty close 
to a <unk>   <unk> Ryan <unk> "One of the 
best matches I've ever found. Well, it has to happen. <unk> 
average and all. Still, it sometimes gives you a <unk> feeling to 
find a rabbit or a snapping <unk> on some strange world. It makes 
you wonder if this exploration business isn't all some big <unk> and 
somebody has been <unk> before you even <unk> ##

THE <unk> looked <unk> at the <unk> The big man seldom 
gave out with such thoughts. Ekstrohm cleared his throat. "What shall 
we do with this <unk> <unk> it"?   Ryan <unk> it with 
his <unk> following <unk> example. "I don't know, <unk> 
It sure as hell doesn't look like any dominant intelligent species 
to me. No hands, for one thing. Of course, that's not definite <unk>   "No, it <unk> Ekstrohm said.   "I 
think we'd better let it lay until we get a clearer picture of the <unk> <unk> around here. In the <unk> we might be thinking on 
the problem all these dead <unk> <unk> What killed <unk> looks like we did, when we made <unk>   "But <unk> about our landing was <unk> to the <unk> Ekstrohm suggested. "The planet is very low 
in radiation from mineral <unk> and the atmosphere seems to <unk> 
out most of the solar <unk> Any little dose of radiation might knock 
off these <unk>   "I don't know about that. Maybe 
it would work the other way. Maybe because they have had virtually 
no radioactive exposure and don't have any <unk> stored up, they 
could take a <unk> without <unk>   "Then maybe it was the <unk> we set up. Or maybe it's sheer <unk> They <unk> 
up and die at the sight of something strange and <unk> like a <unk> the captain <unk> "At this stage 
of the game anything could be possible. But there's one possibility 
I particularly don't <unk>   "And that <unk> <unk> it was <not> us 
that killed these <unk> Suppose it is something 
right on the <unk> native to it. I just hope it doesn't work 
on <unk> too. These <unk> went real <unk> <unk> 
lay in his bunk and thought, the camp is quiet.   The <unk> made camp outside the <unk> There was no reason to leave 
the comfortable quarters inside the ship, except that, faced with 
a possibility of sleeping on solid ground, they simply had to get <unk> camp was a cluster of aluminum <unk> <unk> with a spy <unk> to alert the <unk> to the approach of any being.   Each 
man had a bubble to himself, <unk> after the long period of enforced <unk> on board the ship.   Ekstrohm lay in his bunk and listened 
to the sounds of the night on <unk> <unk> There was a <unk> 
of wind, and a cracking of the frozen ground. <unk> there were on 
the world, but they were frozen solid during the night, only to revive 
and thaw in the morning sun.   The bunk he lay on was much more <unk> than the acceleration <unk> on board. Yet he knew the 
others were sleeping more <unk> now that they had renewed their 
contact with the matter that had <unk> them to send them riding high <unk>   Ekstrohm was not asleep.   Now there could be an 
end to <unk>   He threw off the light blanket and swung 
his feet off the <unk> to the floor. Ekstrohm stood up.   There 
was no longer any need to <unk> But what was there to do? What had 
changed for him?   He no longer had to lie in his bunk all night, 
his eyes closed, pretending to sleep. In <unk> he could walk <unk> leave the light on, read.   It was small comfort for <unk> never <unk> Some doctors had informed him he 
was mistaken about this. Actually, they said, he did sleep, but so shortly 
and <unk> that he <unk> Others admitted he was absolutely <unk> he <never> <unk> His body processes only slowed down enough 
for him to <unk> fatigue <unk> Occasionally he fell into a <unk> <unk> <unk> but he never <unk>   Never at <unk> he couldn't let his <unk> know this. <unk> 
would ground him from the <unk> Service, on physiological 
if not psychological grounds. He had to hide it. <unk> the 
years, he had had <unk> in space in whom he thought he could <unk> 
The <unk> invariably took advantage of him. Since he couldn't <unk> anyway, he might as well stand their <unk> for them or write 
their reports. Where the hell did he get off threatening to report 
any <unk> on their part to the <unk> A man with <unk> had 
better avoid bad dreams of that kind if he knew what was good for <unk> had to hide his <unk>   In a camp, instead of <unk> hiding the secret was easier. But the secret itself was 
just as hard.   Ekstrohm picked up a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> library, a book by <unk> the famous twentieth century expert 
on sex. He scanned a few lines on the social <unk> of a celebrated 
nineteenth century sex <unk> but he couldn't seem to concentrate 
on the <unk> <unk> <unk> style.   On <unk> 
he <unk> up the heat control on his <unk> and slid back the <unk> of the <unk>   Ekstrohm walked through the alien glass 
and looked up at the unfamiliar <unk> <unk> the frozen <unk> 
of the thin air.   Behind him, his mates stirred without <unk> <unk> was startled in the morning by a <unk> on the <unk> of his <unk> It took him a few seconds to put 
his thoughts in order, and then he got up from the bunk where he had been <unk> <unk>   The angry <unk> face of Ryan greeted 
him. <unk> <unk> this isn't the place for fun and games. 
What did you do with <unk>   "Do with <unk> dead <unk> All the dead animals laying around the <unk> are you talking about, <unk> What do you think I 
did with <unk>   "I don't know. All I know is that they 
are <unk>   <unk>   Ekstrohm <unk> 
his way outside and scanned the <unk>   There was no ring of animal <unk> <unk> Nothing but <unk> grass whipping in the keen <unk>   "I'll be <unk> Ekstrohm said.   "You 
are right now, <unk> <unk> doesn't like anybody <unk> up primary <unk>   "Where do you get off, <unk> Ekstrohm <unk> "Why pick me for your <unk> This has got to be some 
kind of local phenomenon. Why accuse a <unk> of being behind <unk> <unk> I want to give you the benefit of

and <unk> you've been involved in".   "What could I 
do with your <unk> dead <unk> What would I want with <unk> I know is that you were outside the bubbles last night,

there are other explanations for the disappearance of the <unk> Look 
for them, will you? I give you my word I'm not trying to pull 
some stupid kind of <unk> or to deliberately <unk> up the <unk> <unk> my word, can't you"?   Ryan shook his head. "I don't

feet and enjoyed the usual routine of the <unk> She was not alone 
for there were three other such children in the big city's special <unk> Soon they all were removed to Central Laboratory School 
where their delicate transformation began.   One of the babies 
died in the initial <unk> but of Helva's <unk> seventeen <unk> in the metal <unk> Instead of kicking feet, Helva's <unk> responses started her <unk> instead of <unk> with hands, 
she <unk> mechanical <unk> As she <unk> more and more <unk> <unk> would be adjusted to operate other mechanisms that went 
into the maintenance and running of a space ship. For Helva was <unk> to be the <unk> half of a scout ship, <unk> with a 
man or a woman, <unk> she <unk> as the mobile half. She would be 
among the elite of her kind. Her initial intelligence tests registered 
above normal and her adaptation index was unusually high. As long 
as her development within her shell lived up to <unk> and there 
were no <unk> from the pituitary <unk> Helva would live 
a <unk> rich and unusual life, a far cry from what she would have <unk> as an <unk> <unk> being.   However, no <unk> 
of her brain <unk> no early <unk> tests recorded certain essential 
facts about Helva that Central must eventually <unk> They 
would have to <unk> their official time and see, <unk> that the massive <unk> of <unk> would <unk> her, too, as the necessary <unk> against her unusual <unk> and the pressures of her profession. 
A ship run by a human brain could not run <unk> or insane with 
the power and resources Central had to build into their scout ships. <unk> ships were, of course, long past the experimental stages. Most <unk> survived the techniques of pituitary <unk> that kept 
their bodies small, eliminating the necessity of transfers from smaller 
to larger <unk> And <unk> very few were lost when the final connection 
was made to the control panels of ship or industrial <unk> <unk> 
people resembled mature <unk> in size whatever their <unk> <unk> <unk> but the <unk> brain would not have changed places 
with the most perfect body in the <unk>   So, for happy years, <unk> <unk> around in her shell with her <unk> playing such <unk> as <unk> <unk> studying her lessons in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> mental <unk> basic <unk> <unk> <unk> space history, law, traffic, <unk> all

to her teachers, Helva <unk> the <unk> of her conditioning as 
easily as she absorbed her <unk> <unk> She would one day be grateful 
to the patient <unk> of the <unk> <unk> civilization was not without <unk> <unk> associations, <unk> possible <unk> to <unk> as well as <unk> <unk> One such group got all <unk> over <unk> <unk> 
when Helva was just turning <unk> When they were forced 
to, Central <unk> shrugged its shoulders, arranged a tour of the Laboratory <unk> and set the tour off to a big start by showing the 
members case <unk> complete with <unk> Very few committees 
ever looked past the first few <unk> Most of their original objections 
about <unk> were <unk> by the relief that these hideous <unk> <unk> bodies <unk> <unk> <unk>   Helva's 
class was doing Fine <unk> a selective subject in her crowded program. 
She had <unk> one of her <unk> tools which she would later 
use for minute repairs to various parts of her control <unk> Her 
subject 
was <unk> a copy of the Last <unk> and her <unk> <unk> 
the head of a tiny <unk> She had <unk> her sight to the proper <unk> As she worked she <unk> <unk> producing a curious <unk> <unk> people used their own vocal <unk> and <unk> but sound <unk> through <unk> rather than <unk> Helva's hum then 
had a curious <unk> a warm, <unk> quality even in its <unk> chromatic <unk>   "Why, what a lovely voice you <unk> 
said one of the female <unk>   Helva <unk> up and caught 
a fascinating <unk> of <unk> dirty <unk> on a <unk> pink surface. 
Her hum became a <unk> of <unk> She instinctively regulated 
her <unk> until the skin lost its <unk> look and the <unk> 
assumed normal <unk>   "Yes, we have quite a few years

could have <unk> she would have. "You people don't have <unk> <unk>   The <unk> of this <unk> grinned with pride 
and amusement as Helva's tone indicated pity for the <unk> this will <unk> suggested <unk> <unk> 
a <unk> device in one extension and holding it over the <unk> a kind of shock, the ladies and gentlemen of the committee <unk> to observe the incredibly <unk> and brilliantly executed Last <unk> on the head of a <unk>   "Well", remarked one gentleman 
who had been forced to accompany his wife, "the good Lord can <unk> where <unk> fear to <unk>   "Are you <unk> <unk> 
asked Helva <unk> "to the Dark <unk> discussions of the number

to develop a sense of <unk> sir, which contributes the same <unk> good man <unk> <unk> and decided the trip 
was worth his time.   If the investigation committee spent months <unk> the thoughtful food served them at the Laboratory School, 
they left Helva with a <unk> as well.   <unk> as <unk> to herself required research. She had, of course, been exposed 
to and enjoyed a music appreciation course which had included the 
better known classical works such as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> de <unk> the atomic age <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> as well 
as the curious rhythmic <unk> of the <unk> <unk> visual <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> But <unk> 
for any shell person posed considerable technical difficulties 
to be <unk> <unk> people were <unk> to examine every aspect of 
a problem or situation before making a <unk> <unk> properly 
between optimism and <unk> the <unk> attitude of the shell 
people led them to <unk> themselves, their ships and <unk> 
from <unk> situations. Therefore to <unk> the problem that she 
couldn't open her mouth to <unk> among other <unk> did not <unk> her. She would work out a method, <unk> her <unk> <unk> she could <unk>   She approached the problem by investigating 
the methods of sound reproduction through the centuries, human and <unk> Her own sound production equipment was essentially more <unk> than <unk> <unk> control and the proper <unk> 
of <unk> sounds within the oral cavity appeared to require the most 
development and practice. <unk> people did not, strictly speaking, <unk> 
For their purposes, oxygen and other <unk> were not drawn from 
the surrounding atmosphere through the medium of lungs but sustained <unk> by solution in their <unk> After <unk> Helva 
discovered that she could manipulate her <unk> unit to sustain <unk> By <unk> the throat muscles and expanding the oral cavity 
well into the <unk> <unk> she could direct the <unk> sounds into 
the most <unk> position for proper reproduction through her throat <unk> She compared the results with tape <unk> of modern <unk> and was not <unk> although her own <unk> had a peculiar 
quality about them, not at all <unk> merely <unk> <unk> 
a <unk> from the Laboratory library was no problem to one trained 
to perfect <unk> She found herself able to sing any role and any 
song which struck her <unk> It would not have occurred to her that 
it was curious for a female to sing bass, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> as she <unk> It was, to <unk> only a matter 
of the correct reproduction and <unk> control required by the 
music <unk>   If the authorities remarked on her curious <unk> they did so among themselves. <unk> people were encouraged 
to develop a <unk> so long as they maintained <unk> in their technical 
work.   On the anniversary of her sixteenth year in her <unk> Helva was <unk> graduated and installed in her ship, 
the <unk> Her permanent <unk> shell was <unk> behind an 
even more <unk> barrier in the central shaft of the scout ship. 
The <unk> <unk> visual and sensory connections were made and <unk> Her <unk> were <unk> connected or augmented and the <unk> <unk> brain <unk> were completed while Helva 
remained <unk> unaware of the <unk> When she <unk> 
she <was> the ship. Her brain and intelligence controlled every 
function from <unk> to such loading as a scout ship of her class <unk> She could take care of herself and her <unk> <unk> in any 
situation already recorded in the <unk> of Central <unk> and any 
situation its most <unk> minds could <unk>   Her first actual <unk> for she and her kind had made mock flights on <unk> panels 
since she was <unk> showed her complete mastery of the techniques 
of her profession. She was ready for her great adventures and the arrival 
of her mobile partner.   There were nine qualified <unk> sitting 
around collecting base pay the day Helva was <unk> There 
were several missions which demanded instant attention but Helva 
had been of interest to several department heads in Central for some 
time and each man was determined to have her assigned to <his> section. <unk> no one had remembered to introduce Helva to the prospective <unk> The ship always chose its own partner. Had there 
been another <unk> ship at the <unk> at the moment, Helva would 
have been guided to make the first move. As it was, while Central <unk> 
among itself, Robert <unk> sneaked out of the <unk> <unk> 
out to the field and over to Helva's slim metal <unk> <unk> anyone at <unk> <unk> <unk>   "Of <unk> <unk> Helva <unk> <unk> her outside <unk> "Are 
you my <unk> she asked <unk> as she recognized the <unk> Service <unk>   "All you have to do is <unk> he <unk> <unk>   "No one has come. I thought perhaps there 
were no partners available and I've had no <unk> from <unk> to herself Helva sounded a little <unk> but 
the truth was she was <unk> sitting on the darkened field. <unk> 
she had had the company of other shells and more recently, technicians 
by the score. The sudden <unk> had lost its <unk> charm and 
become <unk>   "No <unk> from Central is scarcely 
a cause for <unk> but there happen to be eight other guys <unk> their <unk> to the quick just waiting for an invitation to board you, 
you beautiful thing". 
It would have killed you in the <unk> Do you have anything for <unk> <unk> not knowing what B'dikkat <unk> and 
the <unk> man answered for him, "I think he has a nice baby head, 
but it isn't big enough for you to take <unk>   Mercer never <unk> the needle touch his arm.   B'dikkat had turned to 
the next knot of people when the <unk> hit <unk> 
He tried to run after <unk> to <unk> the lead <unk> to tell <unk> that he loved him. He stumbled and <unk> but it did not <unk>   The <unk> girl lay near him. Mercer spoke to <unk> it <unk> You're beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. 
I'm so happy to be here".   The woman covered with 
growing hands came and sat beside them. She <unk> warmth and good <unk> Mercer thought that she looked very distinguished and <unk> 
He struggled out of his clothes. It was foolish and <unk> 
to wear clothing when none of these nice people did.   The two 
women <unk> and <unk> at him.   With one corner of his mind 
he knew that they were saying nothing, just expressing the <unk> of 
a drug so powerful that the known universe had forbidden it. With most 
of his mind he was happy. He wondered how anyone could have the good <unk> to visit a planet as nice as this. He tried to tell the Lady <unk> but the words weren't quite straight.   A painful <unk> 
hit him in the <unk> The drug went after the pain and swallowed it. 
It was like the cap in the hospital, only a thousand times better. 
The pain was gone, though it had been <unk> the first <unk> forced himself to be <unk> He <unk> his mind into focus 
and said to the two ladies who lay <unk> nude beside him in the <unk> <unk> was a good <unk> Maybe I will grow another head. That 
would make B'dikkat <unk>   The Lady Da forced the <unk> 
of her bodies in an upright position. Said she, "I'm strong, <unk> I can talk. <unk> man, remember. People never live forever. 
We can die, too, we can die like real people. I do so believe 
in <unk>   Mercer smiled at her through his <unk> course you can. But isn't this nice **h"   With 
this he felt his lips <unk> and his mind go <unk> He was wide <unk> 
but he did not feel like doing anything. In that beautiful place, 
among all those <unk> and attractive people, he sat and <unk> was <unk> his <unk> <unk> wondered 
how long the <unk> had lasted him. He endured the <unk> 
of the <unk> without <unk> or movement. The <unk> of nerves 
and <unk> of skin were phenomena which happened somewhere near 
him, but meant nothing. He watched his own body with <unk> casual <unk> 
The Lady Da and the <unk> woman stayed near him. After 
a long time the half-man dragged himself over to the group with his 
powerful arms. Having arrived he <unk> <unk> and <unk> at 
them, and <unk> back into the <unk> <unk> from which he had <unk> 
Mercer saw the sun rise on occasion, closed his eyes briefly, and 
opened them to see stars <unk> Time had no meaning. The <unk> <unk> him in their mysterious <unk> the drug canceled out his needs for <unk> of the body.   At last he noticed a return of the <unk> 
of pain.   The pains themselves had not <unk> he <unk> knew all the events which could take place on <unk> He 
remembered them well from his happy period. <unk> he had noticed <unk> now he felt them.   He tried to ask the Lady Da how long 
they had had the <unk> and how much longer they would have to wait 
before they had it again. She smiled at him with <unk> remote <unk> 
apparently her many <unk> stretched out along the ground, had 
a greater capacity for retaining the drug than did his body. She meant 
him well, but was in no condition for articulate speech.   The <unk> lay on the ground, arteries <unk> <unk> behind the <unk> film which protected his <unk> <unk>   Mercer <unk> the man's shoulder.   The half-man <unk> recognized 
Mercer and gave him a <unk> <unk> <unk>   <unk> good <unk> to you, my <unk> That's out of a play. Did you ever see 
a <unk>   "You mean a game with <unk>   "No", 
said the <unk> "a sort of <unk> with real people doing 
the <unk>   "I never saw that", said Mercer, "but <unk>   "But you want to ask me when B'dikkat is going 
to come back with the <unk>   "Yes", said Mercer, a little <unk> of his <unk>   <unk> said the <unk> <unk> why I think of <unk> We all know what is going to happen. 
We all know when it is going to happen. We all know what the <unk> 
will <unk> he <unk> at the <unk> in which the <unk> 
men were <unk> "and we all know what the new people will <unk> 
But we never know how long a scene is going to <unk>   "What's 
a <unk> asked <unk> "Is that the name for the <unk>   The half-man laughed with something close to real <unk> "No, no, no. You've got the <unk> on the brain. A 
scene is just a part of a play. I mean we know the order in which things <unk> but we have no clocks and nobody cares enough to count days 
or to make <unk> and there's not much climate here, so none of 
us know how long anything <unk> The pain seems short and the pleasure 
seems long. I'm inclined to think that they are about two <unk> <unk>   Mercer did not know what an <unk> 
was, since he had not been a <unk> man before his conviction, but 
he got nothing more from the half-man at that time. The half-man received 
a <unk> <unk> turned red in the face, shouted <unk> 
at Mercer, "Take it out, you <unk> Take it out of <unk> Mercer looked on <unk> the half-man twisted over on 
his side, his pink dusty back turned to Mercer, and wept <unk> and <unk> to himself.   Mercer himself could not tell how long it 
was before B'dikkat came back. It might have been several days. 
It might have been several months.   Once again B'dikkat moved 
among them like a <unk> once again they <unk> like children. 
This time B'dikkat smiled pleasantly at the little head which had <unk> out of Mercer's <unk> a sleeping child's head, covered 
with light hair on top and with <unk> eyebrows over the resting eyes. 
Mercer got the <unk> <unk>   When B'dikkat cut the head 
from Mercer's <unk> he felt the knife grinding against the <unk> 
which held the head 
to his own body. He saw the <unk> <unk> 
as the head was <unk> he felt the far, cool flash of <unk> pain, 
as B'dikkat <unk> the wound with a <unk> <unk> which 
stopped all bleeding immediately.   The next time it was two legs 
growing from his chest.   Then there had been another head beside 
his own.   Or was that after the <unk> and legs, <unk> to <unk> 
of the little girl which had grown from his <unk>   He <unk> the order.   He did not count time.   Lady Da smiled 
at him often, but there was no love in this place. She had lost 
the extra <unk> In between <unk> she was a pretty and <unk> <unk> but the <unk> thing about their relationship was her <unk> 
to him, repeated some thousands of time, repeated with smiles and <unk> "People never live <unk>   She found this immensely <unk> even though Mercer did not make much sense out of <unk> events occurred, and victims changed in appearance, and 
new ones <unk> Sometimes B'dikkat took the new ones, resting in 
the everlasting sleep of their <unk> <unk> in a <unk> 
to be added to other <unk> The bodies in the truck <unk> and <unk> 
without human speech when the <unk> struck them.   Finally, 
Mercer did manage to follow B'dikkat to the door of the <unk> He 
had to fight the <unk> of <unk> to do it. Only the memory 
of previous <unk> <unk> and <unk> made him sure that if 
he did not ask B'dikkat when he, Mercer, was happy, the answer would 
no longer be available when he needed it. Fighting pleasure itself, 
he begged B'dikkat to check the records and to tell him how long 
he had been there.   B'dikkat <unk> <unk> but he did not 
come out of the doorway. He spoke through the public address box built 
into the cabin, and his gigantic voice roared out over the empty <unk> 
so that the pink herd of talking people stirred gently in their <unk> and wondered what their friend B'dikkat might be wanting 
to tell them. When he said it, they thought it exceedingly <unk> 
though none of them understood it, since it was simply the amount of time 
that Mercer had been on <unk>   <unk> years- <unk> 
years, seven months, three days, two hours, eleven and one 
half minutes. Good luck, <unk>   Mercer turned <unk> secret little corner of his mind, which stayed <unk> through happiness 
and pain, made him wonder about <unk> What persuaded the <unk> to remain on <unk> What kept him happy without <unk> <unk> B'dikkat a crazy slave to his own duty or was he a 
man who had hopes of going back to his own planet some day, surrounded 
by a family of little <unk> <unk> <unk> Mercer, despite 
his <unk> wept a little at the strange fate of <unk> His 
own fate he <unk>   He remembered the last time he had <unk> 
actual eggs from an actual <unk> The <unk> kept him alive, 
but he did not know how they did it.   He staggered back to the <unk> The Lady <unk> naked in the dusty <unk> waved a <unk> hand 
and showed that there was a place for him to sit beside her. There 
were <unk> square miles of <unk> space around them, but he appreciated 
the <unk> of her gesture none the <unk> <unk> 

The years, if they were years, went by. The land of <unk> did not <unk>   Sometimes the <unk> sound of <unk> came <unk> across 
the plain to the herd of men; those who could talk declared it 
to be the breathing of Captain <unk> There was night and day, but 
no setting of <unk> no change of <unk> no generations of men. Time 
stood still for these people, and their load of pleasure was so <unk> 
with the <unk> and pains of the <unk> that the words of the <unk> Da took on very remote meaning.   "People never live <unk> statement was a hope, not a truth in which they 
could believe. They did not have the wit to follow the stars in their <unk> to exchange names with each other, to harvest the experience 
of each for the wisdom of all. There was no dream of escape for these <unk> Though they saw the <unk> chemical rockets lift up from 
the field beyond <unk> cabin, they did not make plans to hide 
among the frozen crop of <unk> flesh.   Far long ago, some 
other prisoner than one of these had tried to write a letter. His <unk> was on a rock. Mercer read it, and so had a few of the others, 
but they could not tell which man had done it. Nor did they <unk> letter, scraped on <unk> had been a message home. They 
could still read the <unk> <unk> I was like you, stepping 
out of my window at the end of day, and letting the winds blow me gently 
toward the place I lived in. Once, like you, I had one head, two <unk> ten fingers on my hands. The front part of my head was called

when I get out of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> WOULD <unk> Ann <unk> He 
was well rid of her. He certainly didn't want a wife who was <unk> 
as <unk> If he had married her, he'd have been asking for <unk> all of this was <unk> Sometimes he woke up in 
the middle of the night thinking of <unk> and then could not get back 
to sleep. His plans and dreams had <unk> around her so much and for 
so long that now he felt as if he had nothing. The easiest thing would 
be to sell out to Al <unk> and leave the country, but there was 
a stubborn streak in him that wouldn't allow it.   The best <unk> 
for the bitterness and disappointment that <unk> him was hard 
work. He found that if he was tired enough at night, he went to sleep 
simply because he was too exhausted to stay <unk> Each day he found 
himself thinking less often of <unk> each day the hurt was a little <unk> a little less <unk>   He had plenty of work to do. 
Because the summer was unusually dry and hot, the spring produced a 
smaller stream than in ordinary years. The grass in the <unk> came <unk> now that the warm weather was here. He could not afford to lose 
a drop of the precious water, so he spent most of his waking hours along 
the <unk> in his <unk>   He had no idea how much time <unk> would give him. In any case, he had no intention of being caught <unk> so he carried his revolver in its <unk> on his hip and he 
took his Winchester with him and leaned it against the fence. He stopped 
every few minutes and leaned on his <unk> as he studied the <unk> 
but nothing happened, each day dragging out with <unk> <unk> in late afternoon on the last day in June, he saw two 
people top the ridge to the south and walk toward the house, he quit work 
immediately and strode to his rifle. It could be some kind of trick <unk> had thought up. No one walked in this country, least of all <unk> <unk> or Dutch <unk> or any of the rest of the Bar ~B crew. 
Morgan watched the two figures for a time, <unk> When they were closer 
and he saw that one was a woman, he was more puzzled than <unk> cleaned his <unk> left it against the <unk> picked up his <unk> and started <unk> His visitors had crawled through 
the south fence and were crossing the <unk> <unk> toward the house. 
Now he saw that both the man and woman were moving slowly and <unk> <unk> as if they found it a struggle to remain on their <unk>   <unk> the house ahead of them, he waited with his <unk> in his hands. They crawled through the north fence and came 
on toward him, and now he saw that both were young, not more than nineteen 
or <unk> They were <unk> their clothes were <unk> and the 
girl was so exhausted that she fell when she was still twenty feet from 
the front door. She lay there, making no effort to get back on her <unk> The boy came on to the porch and sat down, his gaze on Morgan 
as if half expecting him to shoot and not really <unk>   Morgan <unk> thinking that if this was a <unk> it was a good one. He 
didn't think it was possible for this couple to be <unk> The 
boy licked his dry lips. He asked, <unk> we have a <unk> jerked his head toward the front door. "In the <unk> 
he said. <unk> his Winchester against the front of the house, 
he walked to the girl. "Get up. There's water in the <unk> didn't move or say anything. Her eyes were <unk> as if 
she didn't hear or even see him. She had reached a point at which 
she didn't even care how she <unk> Her face was very thin, and burned 
by the sun until much of the skin was dead and <unk> the new <unk> under it red and angry.   Her blond hair was <unk> her dress <unk> in several places, and her shoes were so completely worn out 
that they were practically no protection. It must have hurt her even 
to <unk> for the sole was completely off her left foot and Morgan saw 
that it was <unk> and <unk>   He picked her up, sliding one 
hand under her shoulders, the other under her knees, and carried her 
into the house. She was <unk> light, and so relaxed in his arms 
that he wasn't even sure she was <unk> Any <unk> suspicion 
that this was a trick Al <unk> had thought up was <unk> No girl 
would go this far to fool a man so she could kill him. Besides, she 
had a sweet face that attracted him.   He put her down on the <unk> and going into the kitchen, saw that the boy had dropped into a <unk> beside the table. They looked a good deal <unk> Morgan thought. 
Both had blonde hair and blue eyes, and there was even a faint similarity 
of <unk>   Morgan filled the <unk> from the water <unk> on the <unk> went back into the front room, lifted the girl's 
head, and held the edge of the <unk> to her mouth. She drank <unk> 
and <unk> "Thank you", as he lowered her head.   He 
stood looking down at her for a moment, wondering what could have reduced 
her to this condition. He had seen a few <unk> wagons go through 
the country, the families almost <unk> to death, but he had never 
seen any of them on foot and as bad off as these two.   The girl 
dropped off to sleep. Morgan returned to the kitchen, built a fire, 
and carried in several <unk> of water from the spring which he poured 
into the copper <unk> that he had placed on the stove. He brought 
his Winchester in from the front of the house, then faced the <unk> are you and what happened to you"? he asked. <unk> Billy <unk> the boy answered. "That's my wife <unk> 
We ran out of money and we haven't eaten for two <unk> are you doing here"?   "Are we in <unk> nodded. <unk> five miles north of the <unk> sighed as if <unk> "We've been looking for work, 
but all the <unk> have turned us <unk>   "You mean you <unk> your wife all over <unk> <unk> looking for <unk> 
Morgan demanded. "The town of <unk> only about six miles 
from here. Why didn't you go there"?   "We didn't want 
town <unk> Jones said.   "This is a mighty empty <unk> 
Morgan said. "There's only one more ranch three miles north 
of here. You'd have <unk> to death if you'd missed both <unk> we're lucky we got here. Could you give us a <unk> Mr& **h"   <unk> Dan <unk>   He was <unk> a moment, thinking he could use a man this time of year, and if 
the girl could <unk> it would give him more time in the <unk> but 
he knew nothing about the <unk> They might kill him in his sleep, thinking 
there was money in the house. He dismissed the possibility at <unk> The girl's thin face haunted him. It wasn't the face of a <unk> He wasn't so sure about the boy. He hadn't shaved for several <unk> his <unk> beard giving his face a <unk> <unk> <unk> was more to this than Jones had told him. They 
were running from something. He'd be an <unk> to let them stay 
he thought, but he couldn't send them on, either.   "I could 
use some <unk> Morgan said finally, "but I can't afford to pay 
you anything. I guess you'd better go on in the <unk> <unk> work for our <unk> the boy said <unk> "I've been <unk> in a mine in the San <unk> but I used to work on a <unk> <unk> she's cooked in a restaurant. We'll work hard, Mr& <unk> see", Morgan said. <unk> now you need 
a meal and a bath. Your wife's in terrible <unk>   "I <unk> Jones said <unk>   Morgan filled the fire box 
with wood again, then started supper and set the table. When the meal 
was <unk> he told Jones to wash up, and going into the front room, <unk> the girl. He said, "I've got some supper <unk>   She <unk> her eyes and <unk> then sat up, her hands going to her <unk> "I'm a <unk> she said, and suddenly she was <unk> "Who

told himself he had never seen two people eat so much. When they were 
finally satisfied, Jones said, "I think he's going to give us <unk> grateful way she looked at Morgan made him ashamed 
of himself. When he saw the expression in her eyes, he knew he couldn't 
send them on. She said, "I guess the Lord looks out for <unk> <unk> and <unk>   Morgan laughed. <unk> are <unk>   "We're not <unk> she said. "That's

he brought more water in from the spring before it got dark. He carried 
the tub from the back of the house where it hung from a <unk> in the <unk> He said: "You'll feel a lot better after you have a bath. 
Your feet are in bad shape, Mrs& Jones. You'll have to go to 
town to see the <unk>   "No, <unk> be all right", Jones 
said quickly. "I mean, we don't have any way to get there and 
we can't expect you to quit work just to take us to town". <unk> see", Morgan said.   <unk> you find me a needle 
and <unk> the girl asked. "My dress needs some work on <unk> nodded and, going into the bedroom, brought a <unk> <unk> and <unk> He said: "I'm going to <unk> He nodded 
at the door in front of him. "That's my spare bedroom. The bed

you'll let us. Some way".   "It's all right", he said. 
"I get up early. You'd better <unk>   Jones followed 
him into the front room, closing the door behind him. He said: "If

can't take any chances on getting her <unk> and if we were sleeping

to rock. He was thinking of <unk> and how he had left him 
there, to rock to death on the porch of the <unk> It was the only 
thing in his life for which he felt guilt. <unk> his black shirt 
his frail shoulders shook and <unk> of pain broke from his throat, the <unk> pain <unk> free in slow <unk> terrible to see. Clayton 
tried to call back the face of the man he had known. Against that other 
man he could rally his <unk> against this bent man in the chair 
he was <unk>   Gavin's lips moved so that Clayton had 
to <unk> to catch the words. "Do you remember Big <unk> he <unk> "He stuck with me all these years. Just a <unk> <unk> never said much, never meant <unk> to me, but he stuck with 
me. He got into a fight with Tom English, your brother's son. 
It was a fair fight, the boy provoked it- Big Charlie told me so. 
I believed him. They killed Big <unk> dumped his body in my rose <unk> two nights ago. My men, they all left me. Just cleared out. 
I didn't understand why, <unk> They just all cleared out. I treated

asked almost <unk> "you want me to go with you, wherever you're <unk>   <unk>   "You don't hate me any <unk> <unk> shook his head, <unk> <unk> here". The old man beckoned with one finger and Clayton

over the saddle <unk> working by touch in the darkness, comforting 
the animal with easy words. When he had finished he led him and 
the mare to the porch. The <unk> had smelled the mare coming into 
heat and began to <unk> the <unk> shaking his head. Clayton <unk> the <unk> in a <unk> over the <unk> post and patted the warm flesh of his <unk> The mare had backed away. "You take it <unk> <unk> Clayton <unk> "She doesn't want you now. You take it <unk> your time

had taken a <unk> down from the wall and it trailed from his hand,

slowly down the steps.   <unk> he said, <unk> are we <unk>   "To a ranch in the valley. There's someone there

broke from the yard, from the circle of light cast by the lamp still 
burning in the house, into the darkness. <unk> <unk> at a measured pace through the valley. <unk> would come soon 
and the night was at its <unk> The moon had sunk below the black crest 
of the mountains and the land, seen through eyes that had grown accustomed 
to the absence of light, looked <unk> as if no man had ever <unk> before. It looked as Gavin had first seen it years ago, 
on those nights when he slept alone by his <unk> and <unk> suddenly 
to the <unk> of an <unk> or the <unk> of a blade of grass in the <unk> <unk> a savage land, <unk> and <unk> too strong to be 
broken by the will of men. Gavin sighed <unk> In that <unk> landscape 
the <unk> of his desires passed before his mind. He saw them <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the broken and the dying. In <unk> 
his mind groped to <unk> the bones of the relationships he had <unk> so <unk> but they would not come to life. The silence <unk> 
him, made him bend low over the <unk> neck as if to hide 
from a wind that had begun to blow far away and was twisting slowly through 
the darkness in its slow <unk>   They passed <unk> that 
were framed dark gray against the black hills. Then at last the darkness 
began to <unk> A bold line of <unk> broke loose from the 
high ridge of the mountains, followed by feathers of red that swept the 
last stars from the sky. The <unk> light spread over the ground and the <unk> revealed in the first <unk> the contours of trees and fences 
and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> been seen as soon 
as they left the <unk> picked out of the darkness by the weary though <unk> eyes of two men posted a few hundred yards away in the <unk> <unk> of the trees. The two men whipped their horses into town 
and flung themselves up the steps of the <unk> crying their <unk> men in <unk> were tired from a night's <unk> their faces red and <unk> But the liquor had <unk> their <unk> They greeted the news <unk> as though they had been <unk> 
of purpose. Lester heard their <unk> saw their eyes reveal their <unk> He worked his tongue round and round in the hollow of his <unk> and his voice came out of his throat, dry and <unk> "He's <unk> That's what you wanted, isn't it? Clayton is with 
him, <unk> him out of the valley. You <unk>   <unk> out

You see, he <unk> to us when he said he was <unk> <unk> <unk> was thinking back many years. First he thought of

his own <unk> feeling, his <unk> Then he thought of a time 
when <unk> horse had fallen <unk> in the <unk> His wife had 
said to him: <unk> is in love with Clayton <unk> He wouldn't

remembered <unk> <unk> smile in the saloon when he had asked 
him what he would do if they brought their cattle to water. It was 
the night Clayton had <unk> them in the <unk> game. "You're Gavin's <unk> Joe <unk> had said.   He turned to <unk> 
"You brought him back to this valley <unk> he would help you find 
your boy. He meant to help Gavin all the time. He made a fool of

now and that's through the <unk> if we ride hard we can take <unk> hand <unk> to <unk> shoulder. The 
boy jerked away.   "He killed <unk> do you understand that"? <unk> turned back to the men and he was drunk with the thing they 
would do, wild to break from the <unk> warmth of the saloon into the 
cold of the <unk> night. He fled through the door and down the steps, <unk> and the men <unk> and followed, pushing Lester to one 
side where he backed against the wall with the sleeve of his jacket raised 
before his eyes to shut out the light. <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
were the last to leave. They mounted up and rode slowly behind the 
others at a safe distance. <unk> THE cold dawn 
the mist <unk> low to the ground, then rose with a <unk> of sudden wind 
to leave the valley clear. The clouds <unk> and hard <unk> of sunlight <unk> down to <unk> the earth with <unk> of white and gold 
light so that the shadows of the running horses flowed like dark streams 
over the dazzling snow. When they turned in the saddle they could 
see the men behind them, <unk> out on the prairie in a flat black line. 
The wind of their running was cold and <unk> the horses were <unk> 
and their <unk> <unk> like stiff black <unk> in the <unk> mare began to tire and Clayton felt the spray of snow from 
the <unk> of Gavin's <unk> He looked over his shoulder at the <unk> <unk> of <unk> They neither gained nor fell back. He rode 
low on the <unk> neck. <unk> of him Gavin turned slightly off the <unk> and pointed for the <unk> no more than a mile away.   Gavin's 
face was <unk> with <unk> He did not look <unk> he 
could feel more than hear the <unk> beat of <unk> that <unk> out 
across the prairie to the <unk> He knew who was riding after him- 
the men he had known all his life, the men who had worked for him, <unk> 
their loyalty to him. Now they were riding to kill him. And he was <unk> <unk> fleeing his death and his life at the same time. 
The land over which he sped was the land he had created and lived <unk> 
his valley. With every <unk> stride of the horse beneath him he <unk> one more patch of earth that had been his, that he would never 
see again. The <unk> looming before him- the place where had confronted 
Jack English on that day so many years <unk> was his <unk> from 
all that had meaning to him.   California is too far, he thought. 
He would never reach <unk> He was too <unk> when he passed 
up and through the corridor of <unk> that lined the trail he could 
see ahead, he was passing from <unk> <unk> was not dead. He was, in fact, showing signs of <unk> 
He had been carrying an <unk> rifle and a <unk> navy <unk> <unk> A bayonet hung in a belt <unk> He was partially <unk> in a cavalry <unk> and <unk> Mike stripped these from him 
and <unk> them. He and Dean tied and <unk> the man, using his belt

trying to decide whether <unk> was strong enough to <unk> But it at 
least offered him a chance for living. He had none here. And, for 
the sake of Julia and <unk> it had to be tried.   The guerrilla <unk> 
remained silent. Light showed in the orderly room across the <unk> ground. Someone evidently was on duty there. No doubt there 
would be men guarding the horses.   About a dozen animals were 
held inside the <unk> as best Mike could make out in the <unk> <unk> this was a precaution so that <unk> would be available

long enough for me to get <unk>   <unk> the pistol <unk> 
he walked to the rear wall of the <unk> It was <unk> by

and straightened from his <unk> <unk>   Mike struck with the muzzle 
of the <unk> But the luck that had been running their way left 
him. The guard instinctively <unk> the blow with his rifle. He tried 
to <unk> the rifle around to fire into Mike's body.   <unk> 
off balance, managed to bat the muzzle away a moment before it <unk> 
The bullet went wide. Mike swung the pistol in a savage <unk> 
This time it connected solidly on the man's <unk> <unk>

"Why not you"? he <unk>   <unk> Mike said <unk> "You're lighter than me. It's our only chance now. <unk> to find these <unk> The rest of us can <unk> up in the house

his way at a <unk> Mike ran down the line, <unk> picket <unk> 
with the <unk> He lifted a screeching war <unk> That touched off 
a total <unk> He darted inside the stockade and freed the horses

The guerrillas were <unk> from their <unk> at the west end of the <unk>   <unk> Mike <unk> "They're <unk> 
the <unk>   He <unk> in shadow along the east wall 
of the stockade and then followed the south wall until he was at the <unk> of the two frame buildings. He crouched there.   His <unk>

the parade ground and through the rear gate in the wake of the departing <unk> All were carrying guns they had seized up, but they were <unk> or hardly clad at all.   <unk> and Calhoun came running 
from the post. They had <unk> in their hands. They <unk> questions 
that were not answered in the <unk> They followed the others 
toward the east <unk> Beyond the stockade rifles began to explode as 
some of the guerrillas <unk> at shadows that they imagined were <unk> made a dash to the rear of the frame buildings. He crawled beneath 
the two supply wagons which stood between the buildings and peered 
around a corner. The area was deserted. A man was standing in the 
open door of the lighted orderly room a few yards to Mike's left, 
but he, too, suddenly made up his mind and went racing to join the <unk> activity at the east end of the <unk>   Mike crawled 
to the door and peered in. The orderly room seemed to be deserted. 
A lantern hung from a <unk> giving light. <unk> inside, he found that

case stood open, containing <unk> which contained powder <unk> seized a blanket from a <unk> in a corner, spread 
it on the floor and used it to form a bag in which he placed his <unk> the load he peered from the door. His <unk>

The stockade was brilliantly lighted and the guerrillas <unk> him. 
They realized the truth. <unk> began to snap past him. One struck

again.   A bullet tore the earth from beneath his foot when he 
was a stride or two from <unk> Another struck him heavily in the thigh 
and he went down.   <unk> were racing toward him. Susan 
and Julia came from the door and dragged him with them. The three 
of them <unk> through the door into the interior and fell in a <unk> bounced to her feet and slammed the door. She crouched 
aside as bullets beat at the <unk> chewing into the <unk> Some <unk> entirely through the <unk> post <unk> The iron <unk> held, 
but the <unk> were in danger of being torn from the <unk> rolled to <unk> grasped her around the knees, dragging her off 
her feet. He <unk> over her to <unk> her, for spent bullets were <unk> against the rear walls.   He peered from a <unk> <unk>

a pistol from the heap of scattered <unk> and <unk> He dropped 
a man with the first <unk> At the same moment <unk> <unk> fired 
the rifle Mike had given him and another guerrilla was hit. That halted 
the <unk> The guerrillas scattered for cover.   The wagons 
were burning <unk> The <unk> had caught fire also. The <unk> 
was spreading to the frame buildings.   The guerrillas realized 
they faced a new problem. <unk> one <unk> "There 
goes our <unk> an' <unk>   "Get a <unk> line <unk> Calhoun shouted. <unk> <unk>   The guerrillas 
began a frantic search for <unk> in which to bring water from 
the spring. But what few <unk> they found were <unk> Many 
of them, in increasing <unk> came running with water in their hats 
in a <unk> effort. Both buildings were in <unk> The heat drove 
the guerrillas back. The roof of the command post began to <unk> the wagons to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> right into the <unk> <unk>   One of the <unk> erupted a massive <unk> of <unk> A sizable supply of powder 
had been touched off. The wagons and the coach were beyond saving and 
so were the buildings.   The glow of the fire reached through the <unk> in the windows, giving light enough to examine Mike's <unk> 
The bullet had torn through the flesh just above the <unk> <unk> 
an ugly <unk> that was forming a pool of blood on the floor. But 
it had missed the bone and had passed on through. Susan and Julia <unk> strips from their clothing and bound the <unk>   Mike tested 
the leg and found that he was able to <unk> around on <unk> it wasn't the earthquake that made him return to his <unk> Now <unk> I don't want to go into any 
more <unk> Here comes <unk> Keep this to <unk> <unk> looking <unk> hurried toward us. "Anything <unk> <unk> The men seem to think so".   <unk> found 
a large war party south of us. They'll probably attack at <unk> <unk> said. He brushed past the clergyman and walked into the 
center of the camp. Using his hands as a <unk> he shouted, <unk> <unk> Fort up! There's a large war party on their <unk> a second, <unk> <unk> <unk> appeared struck <unk> Then <unk> Billy began shouting orders to round up the <unk> and fill 
the water <unk> and for the cooks to hurry up with the <unk> They 
all flew into action.   "That was a terrible thing to <unk> 
I 
said to <unk> The <unk> treated us like friends. And here all 
the time you knew the Sioux would be using our rifles on <unk> God, 
what a world you people live in".   <unk> gave me an <unk> <unk> "Old <unk> got the largest war party ever seen on the <unk> 
he said <unk> "What would you have done in <unk> <unk> Let Old <unk> come up and kill you and your people, or 
would you steer him on someone <unk> He shook his head. "Mr& <unk> did that in the war. That's why the British never got the <unk> to fight for the <unk> Mr& <unk> whispered in the ears 
of the Sioux that the <unk> were <unk> to raid 'em for their <unk> Then he went on to the <unk> and told them that the Sioux 
was goin' to move up. He did that with all the Nations. Hell, 
they were <unk> each other so hard they had no time for anyone 
else. The War Department wrote Mr& <unk> a letter and said he 
was a hero. I saw that letter. He carried it in a little <unk> made 
of fish <unk>   "But that was <unk> I said. "There's 
no war on now".   "You're wrong, <unk> In this country <unk> a war on every time the grass turns green. First it was

I dug in behind one of the <unk> we were using as protection, I <unk> 
found myself agreeing with <unk> <unk> especially when I imagined 
what would have happened to <unk> if Old <unk> large party

the Sioux and the <unk> the <unk> are not great <unk> nor

nation, they have relied on their <unk> only for defense and for <unk> in the endless wars of the <unk> Still, I was disgusted 
with myself for agreeing with <unk> methods.   <unk> 
he had told the others what he had done. In the brief moment I 
had to talk to them before I took my post on the ring of <unk> I 
indicated I was <unk> by the methods men employed to live and trade

to do. Those little children **h".   But <unk> replied <unk> <unk> ain't easy to dodge out in this country, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> camp just as the first <unk> threads <unk> together the hills and the sky. Our camp was 
in the center of a wide valley. <unk> had set up a strong position, 
using every <unk> and box we had in addition to <unk> of <unk> and <unk> He had ordered the <unk> brought inside the fortified circle 
and had assigned Pierre and a band of picked <unk> the job of trying 
to keep them steady under fire.   The <unk> herd was the one <unk> in our <unk> the <unk> undoubtedly would try to cut down as 
many of the animals as possible. <unk> <unk> horses would make the 
position difficult to defend against charging <unk>   The cooks 
had prepared one of the best meals we'd had in a long time, and 
on <unk> orders had baked enough bread to last the day. <unk> 
were <unk> the herd fed and <unk> The worst part had been the <unk> although we didn't expect the attack before <unk> the long <unk> night, filled with the sounds of the <unk> insects, seemed <unk> <unk> and hunting <unk> sounded like <unk> Indian <unk> the <unk> of a restless <unk> made one's skin <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> his rifle <unk> in his <unk> I didn't catch 
a <unk> Every time I closed my eyes, I saw Gray Eyes rushing at 
me with a knife.   It was a relief when they finally <unk> poured through the opening in the valley, then spread out in 
a long line to come at us, <unk> their <unk> and filling the morning 
with their <unk> <unk> cry.   <unk> <unk> 
called "I'll get Gray <unk>   <unk> be a pleasure 
to see", the big black murmured as he stared down the barrel of 
his rifle.   <unk> your <unk> <unk> was <unk> "Wait 
until my shot. I'll shoot the first man who <unk> could see them in my <unk> They were about a mile <unk> under 
me the ground <unk> slightly. At first they were only feathers 
and dark <unk> faces and bodies, <unk> over their <unk> <unk> <unk> they emerged as men. Gray Eyes was in the lead. 
His face was split by a <unk> <unk> his eyes were <unk> of <unk> <unk> red and black medicine symbols covered his chest. He was <unk> except for a <unk> Next to him was a young boy I was sure 
had sat near me at one of the trading <unk> His mouth was open, his <unk> <unk> with the strain of his <unk> I found his chest in my <unk> It had a red circle. The circle came nearer and <unk> God, how long is he going to wait, I thought **h.   <unk> <unk> <unk> At first I thought he had missed. Gray Eyes 
remained <unk> The <unk> <unk> was still above his head. As 
he started to <unk> over, another <unk> swung him onto his <unk> squeezed the <unk> At the last second I dropped my sights 
from the bare chest and bright red circle to the chest of his <unk> 
I saw the <unk> fall like a stone and the young <unk> flew over its 
head, bouncing like a rubber ball. He started to run but <unk> shot 
caught him on the <unk> He jerked once in the grass and lay <unk> you're goin' to kill <unk> kill <unk> <unk> <unk>   What else he said was lost in the <unk> of <unk> 
on all sides. The <unk> broke under the <unk> fire, wheeled 
and <unk>   <unk> up! <unk> up! They'll be <unk> <unk> was <unk>   Far up the valley I could see the <unk> <unk> and <unk> Out in front of our walls the grass 
was covered with dead and dying men, war <unk> <unk> blankets and <unk> and dead horses. The morning air was filled with the <unk> <unk> of <unk> blood, the <unk> <unk> of frightened horses, 
and the bitterness of burned powder. A horse screamed as it twisted from 
side to side in a <unk> A rifle <unk> the square head fell <unk> One of the <unk> suddenly leaped to his feet and began running 
across the valley to the trees that lined the small <unk> His legs <unk> <unk> his long black hair <unk> out behind him. There 
was a ragged <unk> He was dead before he hit the ground. <unk> Christ's sake, don't waste your powder on one of <unk> <unk> shouted <unk> "Wait for the <unk> The charge, 
I tell you"!   The sharp <unk> at the end of the valley were <unk> They grew <unk> as the Indians charged again. I could see 
their faces glistening with sweat and bear <unk> their mouths open, <unk> their <unk> <unk>   <unk> Eyes is <unk> <unk> said.   The war captain had been badly wounded and was 
fighting to hold his seat. I could see the blood running down his <unk> He was riding between two <unk> who held him erect when he 
started to <unk>   I forgot to aim. In my sights I watched 
him looming bigger and <unk> <unk> shot had caught him high in 
the <unk> there was no doubt he was dying. Again we waited for <unk> 
This time he delayed so long that some of the <unk> shouted <unk> but they held their fire. The horses were only several <unk> away when he <unk> The bullet flung Gray Eyes from his horse. 
Our rolling <unk> swept most of the other <unk> from their <unk> 
But a few reached our wall. I heard the <unk> of an <unk> and a <unk> 
face burst apart in a <unk> <unk> I saw Little Billy rise 
and fire almost point blank and an <unk> face became shattered <unk> and bone. A second leaped from his horse to the top of the <unk> <unk> four <unk> in such rapid succession it didn't seem possible 
they were in flight. Men screamed. <unk> reached up, jerked the <unk> 
from the <unk> and snapped his neck. Other Indians were running at 
the <unk> <unk> and waving <unk> Reverend <unk> got one, 
the <unk> the others. I saw the clergyman <unk> for a moment by 
the <unk> body of the man he had shot, then run back to his <unk> <unk> were almost <unk> The <unk> of dust 
they raised made it difficult to see when the <unk> charged again. 
This time more of them <unk> the <unk> A small Indian <unk> at <unk> who caught him with a swift upward stroke of his rifle <unk> 
It sounded like a man kicking a <unk> Above me a dark <unk> was <unk> his <unk> with a <unk> in an attempt to <unk> the <unk> my shot killed his horse, he rolled off the <unk> on top of 
me. I could smell <unk> <unk> and oil. His eyes were dark, <unk> <unk> and he gave a sigh as my knife went in. <unk> over the 
wall he had seemed like a hideous <unk> Now under me I could see 
him for what he really was, a boy dressed up in <unk> of paint <unk> <unk> made one last desperate charge. It was <unk> 
to see the thin ranks of <unk> old and young, <unk> and twisting 
their <unk> <unk> from side to side only to be tumbled bleeding 
from their <unk> by the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> efficient <unk> <unk> badly <unk> gripped hands in <unk> knees 
in <unk> held on as long as possible and then, weak from ghastly <unk> slipped <unk> slowly, almost <unk> to be broken under 
the <unk> <unk> Some gracefully <unk> from the backs of their <unk> screaming <unk> to make one last <unk> charge before the 
lead split their hearts or tore their <unk> **h.   None of them 
reached our walls again. The few survivors <unk> turned away. In 
the distance we could hear the drums and the <unk> of the death song. 
She was carrying a <unk> and she started to raise it, then let it fall 
again and <unk> from her <unk>   "I saw your <unk> she 
said, speaking slowly, making an effort to control her anger. "You 
could burn down this whole <unk> with a fire that size. It wouldn't 
matter to a fool like you. It would to me".   "All <unk> Wilson said quickly. "The <unk> too <unk> And I appreciate 
the <unk>   He was losing patience again. An hour <unk> with the children asleep and nothing but the strange darkness, 
he would have appreciated company. She had helped him change his <unk> not <unk> you", she said. "I'm telling you. 
That <unk> too <unk> Let it burn down. And make sure it's out 
when you leave in the <unk>   He was taken <unk> It 
took him a long time to <unk> himself.   "There's some <unk> 
he said <unk> "You're right about the fire. It's bigger 
than it has to be, though I don't see where it's doing any <unk> But you're wrong about the rest of it. I'm not leaving in 
the morning. Why should I? I own the place".   She showed 
her surprise by <unk> the reins and moving the <unk> around so 
that she could get a better look at his face. It didn't seem to tell 
her anything. She glanced around the <unk> taking in the wagon 
and the load of supplies and <unk> scattered over the ground, the 
two <unk> the <unk> bull that was chewing its <unk> just within the 
far reaches of the <unk> She studied it for a long time. Then 
she turned back to Wilson and smiled, and he wasn't quite sure what 
she meant 
by it.   "You own this <unk> she said, and her tone 
had softened until it was almost <unk> "You bought <unk> a man in St& <unk> Wilson said. <unk> <unk> 
Maybe you know him".   The girl laughed. "I know him. 
I ought to. My father ran him off here six years <unk>   Wilson 
didn't say anything. He stood watching the girl, wondering what 
was coming next. She had picked up the <unk> and was <unk> it around 
her <unk> and smiling at him.   <unk> didn't tell you <unk> she said.   "No", Wilson said. "But it's <unk> 
It's not the kind of thing that a man would be proud of. 
And it doesn't make any difference. He sold me a clear <unk> I 
have it with me, right here. If you want to <unk>   <unk> <unk> she said <unk> "It wouldn't matter to my father, 
and not to me. I meant what I said about that fire. Be sure it's 
out when you leave. That's all. I'll let you go back to doing the <unk> now".   It was meant to insult him, and didn't quite <unk> He took the reins just below the bit and held them firmly, 
and it was his turn to smile now. "I don't mind washing dishes now 
and <unk> he said <unk> "It doesn't <unk> It might hurt <unk> though. Somebody might mistake you for a <unk> meant to say more, but he never got the chance. She was <unk> 
She brought the <unk> down, <unk> it across his <unk> and he tried 
to step back. She swung the <unk> again, and this time he caught her <unk> and pulled her out of the <unk>   She came down against 
him, and he tried to break her fall. He grabbed her by the shoulders 
and went down on one <unk> taking her weight so that some of the wind 
was driven out of him. It made him a little sick, and he let go of 
her. He got up slowly, and she was already on her feet, and he stood <unk> her. He wiped the blood from his cheek.   "I ought <unk> 
he said. He was shaking with anger, his breath coming in long, <unk> <unk> "That <unk> I ought to use it on you, where it would 
do the most good. If you were a <unk>   "She <unk> <unk>   The voice came from behind him, and Wilson <unk> 
The fire had gone down, and the man was only a shadow against the <unk> But a moment later he brought his horse forward into the light, 
and Wilson had a good look at him. He was tall and <unk> a <unk> Wilson thought. And he was handsome, despite the long thin <unk> that <unk> across his cheek.   "She's not a man, <unk> he said. "I am. If you've got any <unk> He raised 
the Winchester and pointed it at <unk> chest.   <unk> 
the rifle down, <unk> the girl said. She seemed <unk> "I 
thought I told you to stay home".   The <unk> eased the <unk> down and rested it across his lap. The scar looked pure 
white in the <unk> his eyes were black and <unk> and <unk> 
"You shouldn't be riding up here after dark, <unk> 
he said quietly. "I can take care of this. It's no job for <unk>   The girl <unk> the <unk> <unk> against her knee 
and <unk> at him. He took it without <unk>   "I said 
go home, <unk> You've got no business up here".   The <unk> 
didn't answer this time. But the scar seemed to pull hard 
at the corner of his mouth, and his eyes were hurt and angry. It made 
Wilson <unk> He watched the <unk> as he turned <unk> They 
could hear the <unk> feet on the dry leaves for a while, then the 
sound faded out.   Wilson brushed the dust from his coat. "Who 
was that"? he asked. "Your personal <unk> You're pretty 
hard on him".   "He works for my <unk> the girl said, 
and then seemed to change her mind. "He's a friend. His <unk> 
Joseph <unk> Is there anything else you want to <unk> now", Wilson said. "I guess I'll find out soon <unk> You've got blood on your cheek. Not yours. <unk> It must 
have got there when you fell against me".   She wiped it off 
with the sleeve of her coat.   "I'll bet that's as close as 
you've been to a man since you were a <unk> Wilson <unk> saw her hand start to work down the leather <unk> toward the handle 
of the <unk> and he grabbed her <unk> "Oh, <unk> he said, 
and 
he was without humor now. "I've had enough of that. I've had enough 
of you. I don't know what goes on around here, and I don't <unk> I don't know what makes you think you can get away with this 
kind of business, and I don't care about that, either. You took me 
by <unk> But I'll know how to handle you next <unk> brought up her free hand to hit him, but this time he was <unk> 
He <unk> her blow and she <unk> stumbling against the <unk> 
She finally <unk> her balance and got up in the <unk> Her <unk> had come off and fallen behind her shoulders, held by the <unk> 
and he could see her face more clearly than he had at any time before. 
He had forgotten that she was so <unk> But her <unk> was what 
he had noticed first, and all the other things had come <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> He had known women like that, one woman 
in <unk> And one had been too many. He watched the girl until 
she had gone into the trees, and waited until he couldn't hear the 
sound of her horse any longer, then went up to where the children were <unk>   They weren't <unk> of course, but they thought 
they were doing him a favor by <unk> He hadn't shown up too 
well in their eyes, letting himself be <unk> by a woman. They 
expected greater things from him, regardless of how trying the circumstances, 
and they were <unk> And determined not to show it. They 
lay a little too <unk> with their eyes straining to stay <unk> to <unk> he said. <unk> of you. There's better 
things to do than listen to something like that. I'll be down at 
the creek finishing the <unk> if you want me".   He found 
the <unk> where he had dropped it and carried it back down to the stream. 
The <unk> was calling again, and he hoped that this time there would 
be no other sounds to <unk> it. Not tonight, at any rate. He had 
a feeling that the girl meant trouble. If she did, he could stand 
it better in the light.   He <unk> <unk> at the <unk> 
and reflected on how things had turned out. That afternoon when they 
had pulled up in front of the <unk> ranch house, his hopes had 
been high. Already some of the pain had gone from <unk> death. 
Not all of it. There would still be plenty of moments of regret and <unk> and guilty relief. But they were starting a new life. And they 
had almost everything they <unk> land, a house, two <unk> <unk> three horses.   The land wasn't all Wilson had expected 
of it. Six hundred and forty <unk> the old man back in St& Louis 
had said; good grass, good water. Well, the grass was there, though 
in some places the ground was too steep for a cow to get to it. The 
water was there, so much of it that it spread all through 
the dead <unk> And there was a <unk> <unk> perhaps, but <unk> in need of <unk>   In the last analysis, though, Wilson 
had little cause to <unk> The place had been <unk> just the 
little he had left after <unk> <unk> and it would serve its <unk> There was only one place where <unk> <unk> description 
had gone badly <unk> the peace and quiet. It hadn't started out 
that way. And he had a <unk> thanks to the <unk> that things 
would get worse before they got better. <unk> had the house cleaned 
up by noon, and Wilson sent the boy out to the meadow to bring 
in the horses. 
He stood on the porch and watched him struggling with 
the heavy <unk> and finally went over to help him. <unk> was already 
in the wagon. They were going to town, and they were both <unk> backed the team into the <unk> and wished they weren't 
going to town at all. He had an uneasy feeling about it. That girl 
last night, what was her <unk> <unk> <unk> It was the only 
thing about her that was the least bit hard to remember.   He finished 
with the team and filled his pipe and stood looking about him. 
He had spent two hours riding around the ranch that morning, and in 
broad daylight it was even less inviting than <unk> <unk> had made 
it <unk> There was <unk> and stands of pine that no grass could grow <unk> and places so steep that cattle wouldn't stop to <unk> But 
there was water. There was an artificial lake just out of sight in 
the first stand of trees, fed by a half dozen <unk> that popped out 
of the ground above the hillside <unk> Yes, there was plenty of water, 
too much, and that was probably the trouble. There were tracks 
of cattle all over his six hundred and forty acres.   The first 
part of the road was <unk> but it leveled off after the second bend and <unk> gradually into the valley. It was hotter once they reached 
the flat, and <unk> but the grass was better. A warm breeze played across 
it, moving it like waves. A <unk> <unk> flew in behind them 
and stayed there, watching for any snakes or <unk> that they might <unk> up from the side of the road. It took them an hour before they came 
to the first houses of <unk>   The town was about what 
Wilson <unk> one main street with its rows of <unk> 
buildings, a water <unk> a few <unk> a single <unk> all dusty 
and <unk> The place was quiet. 
Such was my state of mind that I did not question the possibility 
of <unk> under the circumstances I was only too willing to confess all. 
I was nearly thirty at the time.   I went to the hall in the <unk> only, on these preliminary matters. It was dark and, I <unk> 
very <unk> only the counter at one end was lighted by a long <unk> tube suspended directly above it. Sometimes I was aware 
of people moving about in the darkness. I would turn away from my 
writing 
in the hope of getting a good look at them but I never quite <unk> 
A glimpse of three of four vague figures, at the <unk> <unk> 
here and there. <unk> as if waiting. The <unk> glow of 
a cigarette. Since they could see me but I not them, their presence 
in the hall disturbed me. The clerk paid them no attention. This impressed 
me, until I realized how limited was his sphere of influence. 
His job simply consisted in <unk> new men. When the phone rang 
he answered it. His authority extended to the far edge of the counter, 
no further. None of the men hanging around the hall bothered to speak 
to him. <unk> was attacking his <unk> He spoke to me in a <unk> <unk> an <unk> which quite <unk> his <unk> He wore 
his white shirt open at the neck, revealing a bit of <unk> pale chest <unk> It was obvious that he wished himself different from the 
sort of person he thought he was. But it was not easy for him and he 
often <unk> When one of the men in the hall behind us <unk> on the 
floor and scraped his <unk> over the <unk> of <unk> I noticed how the <unk> <unk> I felt certain he was really a <unk> little man. 
His hat (the cause of his <unk> hung on a <unk> on the wall, and <unk> it I could see his <unk> <unk> ready to be slipped over 
his head, a black <unk> of <unk> <unk> that ought never to 
have left his neck. The <unk> <unk> were on the counter, and 
a stack of <unk> men's <unk> On a shelf in the office behind 
the counter was a small radio <unk> permanently on a station which <unk> only <unk> commercials and cheap popular music. Everything 
about the clerk was <unk> Once, pressing him, I learned that his 
job was only <unk> in the afternoons when nothing went on in the <unk> <unk> my disappointment he attempted to salvage what <unk> 
and <unk> of authority he felt might still be <unk> to his person. 
With distaste I saw him assume a <unk> air. When he saw me coming 
he turned his radio off. He made a show of <unk> my forms on 
the <unk> He would pick up the ringing phone with studied <unk> 
then bark into it with <unk> importance. What limited knowledge he <unk> he forced upon me. In the <unk> I was <unk> <unk> <unk> similar to the one above the counter, illuminated the entire <unk> They, and the two large fans which I could dimly see as <unk> filtered through their <unk> down at the far end of the hall, 
could be turned on by a master switch situated inside the office. He 
pointed out the switch to me and for a moment I <unk> believed 
that he would let deed follow words. I was <unk> <unk> a batch of 
white tickets of the sort handed out, he told me, every morning. Now, 
here was something of obvious importance to me, yet when I reached 
for the tickets he snatched them away from my hand. He couldn't afford 
to have anyone mess around with them, he said. Each of those tickets 
was of great value to its <unk> <unk> I withdrew my hand. <unk> I would remember what this <unk> little man had told me about 
the worth of a <unk>   Having nothing else to do except wait 
for my forms to be <unk> I gave myself over to <unk> concerning 
the hall itself. When <unk> <unk> what would it look <unk> 
The presence of the two exhaust fans seemed to indicate that the <unk> could become crowded for air. One afternoon, upon receiving permission 
and the necessary instructions from the clerk, I had visited 
the toilet adjoining the hall. By counting the number of <unk> and <unk> I attempted to form a loose estimate of how many men the hall 
would hold at one time. For although I had crossed a corner of the <unk> on my way to the toilet I still could not tell for sure how far 
to the rear the darkness <unk> I could observe the two fans down 
at the end, but their size in themselves meant nothing to me as long 
as I had no measure of <unk> I had for some time been <unk> 
in <unk> for one of the dim figures to pass between the fan <unk> and <unk> I knew that three or four of them were almost always present 
in the hall, but what they were doing, and exactly where, I could not <unk> 
It was, I felt, possible that they were men who, having received no <unk> for that day, had remained in the hall, to sleep perhaps, in 
the corners <unk> removed from the counter with its overhead light. 
This light did not penetrate very far back into the hall, and my eyes 
were <unk> rather than aided by the dim daylight entering through 
the fan <unk> when I tried to pick out whatever might be <unk> or <unk> on the floor below. Also the clerk appeared to <unk> 
of my frequent curious <unk> back over my shoulder. No sooner would 
I turn my head away from the counter before he would address me, at 
times quite <unk> in order to bring back my attention. And I had 
hardly finished my business in the toilet on the <unk> occasion 
when the lights in that place, like the hall lights controlled from 
the switch in the office, <unk> off and on <unk> This sort 
of <unk> <unk> annoyed me. I felt certain it was <unk> 
It sprang from a type of <unk> I'd encountered often enough but 
certainly had not expected to find here. I decided to see no more of 
the clerk until the processing of my papers was completed.   I 
felt strongly attached to the hall, however, and hardly a day passed when 
I did not go to look at it from a distance. I lived in a state of <unk> because of it. I could not <unk> to my past nor did I wish 
to. I had signed it off on the forms. My future lay solely with the <unk> yet what did I know about the hall at this <unk> Although 
I had been inside it I had not yet seen it <unk> I wished to <unk> myself but did not even know what sort of clothes I ought to 
be <unk> I did not <unk> <unk> far from it! I was constantly <unk> for clues around the neighborhood of the hall. Though 
only a relatively short walk separated it from my own part of town, 
its character was wholly foreign to me. <unk> <unk> <unk> the 
street on which the hall <unk> The river was only a few blocks away 
but an unbroken line of <unk> prevented me from seeing it. Sometimes 
I noticed the tops of <unk> <unk> and <unk> reaching above the <unk> <unk> The sounds <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> men <unk> indicated great activity and excited me. The hall, on the 
other hand, appeared <unk> and deserted on these long waterfront <unk> It resembled nothing I'd ever seen before. Its front 
was <unk> but irregularities in the masonry might be an indication 
that windows, now <unk> had once looked out upon the street. I 
kept <unk> the block hoping to see, from the street behind it, the <unk> of the hall. But it was not a tall structure and other buildings <unk> it. For weeks I wandered about this neighborhood of <unk> 
and <unk> truck <unk> and taxi repair <unk> gasoline <unk> 
and <unk> lunch <unk> yet never did I cease to feel <unk> a stranger there.   I returned to the hall, despite my dislike 
for the <unk> As I had expected, he insisted that my visits 
to the hall would do nothing to further the process of my <unk> <unk> spring had passed well into summer. At last, when I put 
it to him <unk> the clerk was forced to admit that the delay in my 
case was <unk> When I asked him what, if anything, I could do about 
it, he surprised me by referring me to the director of the hall. 
I could consult this <unk> on any <unk> morning, though not before 
ten o'clock. The clerk impressed this upon <unk> that I should 
not arrive in the hall before ten o'clock. When I went for my interview 
with the director I saw why. Although it was dark as usual I 
could see that the hall had only recently contained a great many people. <unk> <unk> <unk> the floor. The big fans were going, drawing 
from the large room the <unk> of <unk> smoke which drifted about 
in pale <unk> <unk> the ceiling. I had felt the draft they were 
making while mounting the stairs. The <unk> itself seemed still 
to be <unk> the heavy <unk> of many men. I stopped by the counter. 
No one was behind it, but in the rear wall of the office I <unk> 
for the first time, a door which had been left partially open. <unk> it I could see part of a desk, a flag in a corner, a rug on 
the floor. The <unk> office. I <unk> my <unk> on the counter. 
The director came to the door. I was at once <unk> although 
just what I had expected him to look like I could not have explained. 
He was a man in his late <unk> with <unk> hair, of medium <unk> he looked <unk> in a <unk> summer suit, brown silk <unk> and <unk> soft <unk> He wore <unk> <unk> <unk> 
they somehow made me expect to see him launch into a <unk> <unk> <unk> any moment. But he came toward me <unk> enough, showed 
me around the counter, offered me a seat inside his office, then walked 
to a file cabinet and got out my <unk> I had the impression 
that he had read my forms, perhaps several times. He did not look 
at them now. As he lowered himself on the chair behind his desk I wondered 
what this <unk> slightly ridiculous man could possibly have to 
do with the workings of the hall. He <unk> in a voice as <unk> 
as his <unk> Why had I <unk> <unk> my <unk> he 
must express his <unk> over seeing a person of my background applying 
at the hall. He had looked over my forms and was impressed by 
what he had seen there; indeed, my scholastic qualifications were such 
that he, a college graduate himself, must <unk> me them. Was I sure, 
he asked, that I knew what I was applying <unk> What sort of men 
I would come into contact with, at the <unk> These questions did 
not surprise <unk> I felt certain that the director, like the afternoon clerk, <unk> moved beyond the counter, that the hall, to them, was a <unk> 
a dark and <unk> place. Though I doubted that he would understand 
me, I told the director my motives for <unk> I had always, I 
said, <unk> after working hard with my hands. This <unk> I went 
on, growing <unk> as my conviction was <unk> had mounted at such 
a rate recently that I now found its realization necessary not only 
to my physical but also to my spiritual <unk> To this effect I 
had already <unk> all connections which bound me to my former existence. 
The flat, hard cap was small, but he thrust it to the back of his <unk> him up".   <unk> with it".   Before 
they could guess his intention Rankin stepped forward and swung the <unk> own gun against the uncovered head, hard. The man went over 
without sound, falling to the bare floor.   Barton said <unk> 
"Why did you do that"?   Rankin <unk> at him. "What 
did you want me to do, kiss him? He dumped me in solitary <unk> caught the lighter man's shoulder and swung him <unk>   "Let's get one thing straight, you and me. The 
only reason we brought you was to get Miller out. If you ever try anything 
without my orders I'll kill you".   Fred Rankin looked 
at him. It seemed to Barton that the green eyes <unk> him, the <unk> smile held <unk> but he had no time to waste <unk> on. Let's <unk>   They filed out through the <unk> door, into the paved square. There were three other men within 
this prison whom Barton would have liked to <unk> but they 
were in other cell <unk> There was no chance. They moved slowly, toward 
the main gate, following the wall. There was no <unk> They had <unk> this night <unk> They reached the guard house without <unk> 
the men on the walls above, and <unk> slipped through the <unk> men were on duty inside, playing <unk> <unk> They 
looked up in surprise as <unk> came in.   "What are you doing 
out of the <unk>   "It's <unk> he said, <unk> 
the man Rankin had hit. "I've got to have <unk>   They <unk> at him. The sergeant in charge climbed to his <unk> wrong with him"?   "He's having some kind 
of a <unk>   The sergeant turned to the door. As he passed through 
it Barton shoved his gun against the man's side.   "One 
sound and you're <unk>   The sergeant <unk> <unk> had 
not followed. <unk> was covering the remaining guard. The man <unk> 
for the <unk> of the alarm <unk> <unk> knocked his arm <unk> <unk> with none of <unk> <unk> he laid the barrel 
of his gun alongside the <unk> head.   They were <unk> 
Even Barton could not quite believe it. It had gone without a <unk> 
They slid through the <unk> in the big gate, <unk> across the dark <unk> Five minutes later they reached the horses. Barton was relieved 
to see that Carl Dill and <unk> Foster had brought extra <unk> 
He had been worried that with Miller and Rankin added to the 
escape party they would be short.   No one <unk> They walked 
the horses, heading along the river, Barton and <unk> Foster in 
the lead, seven men riding quietly through the night.   The only 
thing which would have attracted attention was that two wore the uniform 
of prison <unk> three the <unk> suits of <unk>   Five <unk>   In a small <unk> against the river they <unk> turning <unk> into the protection of the trees. Foster had brought extra clothing <unk> A good man, <unk> He had been one of the original Night <unk> one who had escaped the trial. It was to him that Barton 
had sent Carl Dill on <unk> release from the prison.   <unk> <unk> was crying softly to himself, <unk> his <unk> suit 
and <unk> into the <unk> <unk> <unk> the worn brown <unk> <unk> <unk> was unusually silent, Rankin <unk> a few paces <unk> <unk> finished his dressing and extended his hand to <unk> won't even try to thank you".   The <unk> guard 
was <unk> He said in a studied voice, "I didn't do it for 
you. I did it for the valley. You're the only man the Night <unk> 
will follow. We've been <unk> and I don't like to <unk> turned away, his eyes falling upon Rankin beside 
his horse.   "Good <unk>   The murderer lifted his head. <unk> you want me to ride <unk>   "You aren't 
one of us. There's nothing for you here".   "I got no place 
to go".   Barton <unk> He did not trust <unk> his <unk> <unk> his killer <unk> But ten years in prison had taught 
him <unk> They were in a fight, <unk> in both numbers and <unk> It was all right to put a bunch of <unk> onto horses, to 
call them Night <unk> to set out to attack the largest mining combination 
the country had ever seen if all they wanted was <unk> But 
if they really hoped to succeed they needed <unk> men who 
knew how to use a gun against men, who would match the <unk> on the 
other side.   "Your <unk> he said briefly, and turned to <unk> <unk> <unk> those uniforms so they won't be <unk> Barton touched Carl <unk> arm and moved off, up the river <unk> He wanted a <unk> <unk> report from Dill on the 
conditions in the valley.   They <unk> on their heels in the <unk> mud and Dill found a cigar in his breast pocket, passing it over <unk> He too knew the <unk> of going for weeks, sometimes months 
without the <unk> of <unk>   Mitchell Barton drew in the fragrance <unk> letting the smoke lie warm and <unk> in his throat 
for a moment before he <unk>   Through the gloom he could not 
see the man beside him clearly but he knew him thoroughly. For his 
first five years in <unk> they had shared a cell.   Carl Dill 
was neither a rancher nor a valley man. He had been the <unk> for 
the mining <unk> and he had stolen fifty thousand dollars of the <unk> money. He had done time for the <unk>   The one 
thing they had in common was their <unk> Both hated Donald <unk> 
It had drawn them together, and since his release from prison Dill 
had worked <unk> to effect this night's escape.   He 
said 
now, "I've got the perfect headquarters set up. The old <unk> <unk>   <unk> Barton knew the place. Twenty years before 
a group of <unk> had bought out the <unk> claims in the rocky <unk> south of <unk> <unk> They had spent a million dollars, <unk> 
in a road, putting up buildings, drilling their <unk> <unk> Then 
the vein had <unk> out and the whole project had been <unk> <unk> washed <unk> said <unk> "but there's a <unk> you can get over with a horse. A company of cavalry couldn't 
come in there if two men were guarding that <unk>   Barton <unk> "How do the valley people <unk>   "As mad as ever. 
But <unk> men keep them off balance, and they don't trust 
me. I'm an <unk> When they learn you're in the hills though, <unk> <unk> don't worry about that".   Barton waited 
for a long moment, then asked the question which lay always <unk> 
in his mind.   "My boy. Did you find him"?   Dill 
was silent as if he hated to answer, and Barton had a cold, sick feeling 
of <unk>   "He's in Morgan's <unk> <unk> in <unk>   "What's he doing <unk>   Again Dill <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> How <unk>   "Your <unk> has 
the <unk> bank in Cap <unk> <unk>   Barton cursed under 
his breath. After another long pause he asked, "How many people 
know who they <unk>   <unk> Your cousin <unk> saw 
to that. He's quite a <unk> you know. He sold out to <unk> men. <unk> informed them of everything you've ever written him. He 
wants your <unk>   Barton stood up. He said <unk> "All <unk> Let's go get the <unk>   Dill had come up also. "I

"But you can't ride into the <unk> That's what they'll

voice was <unk> than Dill had ever heard it. "I never

#CHAPTER <unk> <unk> <unk> the telegraph <unk> in half a dozen <unk> carrying away whole sections to make repairs more difficult. It 
was over an hour before their escape was discovered, but still the 
news that Barton was free flashed across the central portion of the <unk> reached Donald <unk> in his massive home in <unk> 
It reached the mines at North San Juan and <unk> It 
brought men out of bed and sent them into hurried <unk> 
For everyone involved knew that the whole valley was a powder <unk> and <unk> Barton the <unk> which could send it into explosive <unk> Hague sat in his office above the <unk> <unk> The 
office was of <unk> four rooms, each heated by an iron stove. The 
building was <unk> by the scene outside. There a dozen giant <unk> 
played their <unk> <unk> of water against the huge <unk> 
of <unk> gravel which was the <unk>   The gravel was 
the bed of an ancient river, <unk> in some <unk> <unk> of <unk> It was partially <unk> by ages and pressure, yet it <unk> 
before the <unk> of the powerful <unk> the force of a thousand 
fire <unk> and with the gold it held washed down through the long <unk> 
A million <unk> of gold a month. A million tons of rock 
and soil and brush.   The <unk> ran twenty-four hours each day. 
Their <unk> like the swelling volume of a hundred <unk> could 
be heard for miles. <unk> like all who worked near the <unk> was partly <unk> from the constant assault against his <unk>   He 
was a big man, wearing a neat <unk> shirt against the cold <unk> <unk> <unk> showed in loose rolls beneath the <unk> Ten years older 
than <unk> <unk> he had <unk> his way up from <unk> in the <unk> 
to manager of the operation.   He was proud of his <unk> <unk> of his job, proud that Donald <unk> and his associates trusted 
him. He lived and breathed for the mining company.   No 
man could have reached his spot nor held it without being <unk> and <unk> had made a virtue of <unk> all of his life.   There 
came a ghost of noise at the office door and Hague swung to see <unk> 
in the entrance from the outer room. Hague had never accustomed 
himself to <unk> The man was tall, thin, with a narrow face and 
a <unk> nose. The eyes always held <unk> eyes of a dead man, <unk> 
as a <unk> with the fixed intensity of a <unk> Even Hague 
was <unk> by the <unk> <unk> that was <unk> 
He knew nothing about the man's history. <unk> had appeared at the <unk> one day bearing a letter from <unk> <unk> was to head the <unk> company police. He ran the change <unk> He threw out the <unk> 
He <unk> the <unk> and handled the shipments of raw <unk> which each week went out to San <unk>   Hague squeezed 
down his uneasy <unk> He pulled open the top <unk> of his desk 
and drew out a <unk>   "This is Mitchell <unk> He broke 
out of <unk> last night. Apparently he <unk> one of the <unk> 
We want him back there or we want him <unk>   <unk> took the 
picture in a lean hand, studying it <unk>   <unk> yes. You know how the <unk> in the <unk> are. They blame us for all their <unk> Ten years ago they <unk> up some of our <unk> It cost us a hundred thousand dollars 
and thirty days lost time to fix them. We don't want <unk> Night <unk> loose again".   The <unk> <unk> <unk> the picture 
into his breast pocket, saying nothing.   <unk> Hague <unk> no words, but now he found himself unable to stop their flow although 
he knew <unk> was aware of all he said. 
If she sensed any unusual preoccupation on the part of her mother, she 
did not comment upon it.   After they had finished <unk> <unk> 
took <unk> the <unk> under her <unk> "so that <unk> Grace 
can teach it about the <unk> and climbed into the station wagon 
beside her mother. She had offered to <unk> but Pamela knew she 
would not feel comfortable about her child until she had personally confided 
her to the care of the little pink woman who chose to be called <unk>   When they reached their <unk> house, Pamela 
said a few <unk> words to Grace and kissed <unk> lightly on 
the <unk> the impulse prompted by a stray <unk> of the type 
to which she was frequently subject these <unk> that they might never 
see one another again. Then she turned the station wagon around and <unk> it back down the hill, with the village as her <unk> <unk> she <unk> she thought about her plan. It was really 
quite simple. So simple, in fact, that it might even <unk> although <unk> now, in her new frame of mind, was careful not to <unk> 
too much <unk> That mistake, she thought, had cost her <unk> 
these past few days, and she wanted to avoid falling into any more of 
the <unk> that the mountain might set for her. She must be cautious 
so as not to alert the <unk> <unk>   When the station wagon <unk> <unk> of the dusty dirt road that led up to the porch of the <unk> 
house, Pamela turned the wheel, guiding the car to its familiar <unk> spot close to the house, and stopped. All of her movements 
were careful and <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of a criminal who 
has plotted his <unk> for months in advance and knows exactly which 
step to take next in the course of the final execution of his <unk> 
She locked the <unk> removed the <unk> stepped out of the car and 
went into the house. Here, she dropped the keys on a small table beside 
the door and went upstairs to her bedroom.   On her bureau lay 
a small, brass <unk> of simple design and faded <unk> an <unk> which, Pamela believed now, had been the property of her <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> He had belonged to this 
land and, perhaps, had <unk> it- and this was the only material 
symbol that remained of him. If she, <unk> were being held responsible 
for his <unk> then hers must be the final act of <unk> She 
would return this symbol to the <unk> as one <unk> seed back into 
the soil every Spring **h or as ancient fertility <unk> demand annual 
human <unk>   <unk> and <unk> she slipped the <unk> into the pocket of her <unk> moved down the stairs and out 
of the house. There was only one place where the mountain might receive <unk> that <unk> <unk> pool <unk> in its secret <unk> <unk> if <unk> were possible, could only be made at that <unk> <unk> <unk> It was there that she would have to enact her <unk> beg <unk>   Perhaps it was <unk> Pamela <unk> Perhaps it was all a vividly conceived dream. But she was 
caught in it, and she faced the terrible possibility that, if it were 
a dream, it was one from which she might never <unk>   <unk> 
the forest now, she who had not dared to enter it before, walked between 
two trees at random and headed in what she believed was the direction 
of the pool. She remembered little of her previous journey there with <unk> and she could but hope that her dedication to her mission 
would enable her to accomplish it.   The forest was open and freely <unk> extending an <unk> hand. The ground was covered with <unk> pine <unk> and the slope was <unk> Birds <unk> and <unk> 
in the trees and the sun, all <unk> and soft, <unk> her shoulders <unk> from time to time. It was not, thought <unk> such 
an evil place after all. No wonder <unk> responded so completely to 
its <unk>   Perhaps she had no reason to fear these trees 
that whispered their secrets above her head as she passed. Was it not <unk> after all, that the forest was in league with her and her 
child **h that its sympathy lay with the <unk> **h that she had <unk> 
in failing to understand <unk>   Pamela felt calm and peaceful 
as she walked along. The slight <unk> that had disturbed the motion 
of her heart when she entered the forest was gone now, and even the <unk> <unk> of trees through which she occasionally passed did not <unk> 
her fear. She regarded them as signs that she was nearing the <unk> she <unk> and she was glad to at last be doing something positive 
in her <unk> <unk> struggle with the mountain and its <unk> <unk>   Having persisted too long in deliberate <unk> and denial of the forces that threatened her, Pamela was relieved 
now to admit their <unk> and to be taking definite steps toward <unk> with them. A few days ago, she would have thought such an <unk> as this utterly <unk> today, on the contrary, it 
seemed utterly reasonable.   She did not pause to consider what 
she would do if her plan should <unk> she directed all of her mental 
and physical energy toward achieving this one <unk> If, as she walked, 
her steps <unk> from time to time, she chose to ignore that <unk> 
If the slope grew <unk> and the <unk> more <unk> she tried not to <unk> <unk> depended upon maintaining her <unk> she must be <unk> and proud and <unk> in order to prove to the mountain that 
she was in <unk>   The forest took on an impersonal <unk> 
It did not care what sort of person <unk> its <unk> <unk> at its <unk> or stripped the <unk> from its <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the forest was simply <unk> fighting man's <unk> 
with more abundant growth and man's <unk> with its own musical <unk> laughter. Red man or white man, <unk> or <unk> the <unk> would accept them all- knowing that it could <unk> equally 
well on <unk> and <unk> knowing that its <unk> mass would 
always <unk> the short span of time allotted to any man.   Pamela 
shook her head. She must not think about time. That was another 
one of those <unk>   In her grim pursuit of <unk> Pamela <unk> her thoughts on her husband. If, when this was all over, she 
found the words to tell him about it, she wondered if he would ever <unk> How could he <unk> her need when he himself was <unk> <unk> <unk> would not <unk> upon his nights, nor would his 
days be haunted by the <unk> <unk> figure of her <unk> <unk> His bright, daylight mind would <unk> away such <unk> they would not dare to face his <unk>   Pamela was <unk> Jim was nowhere <unk> His presence would have interfered with 
her duty.   The <unk> grew <unk> and she slipped once 
or twice on the smooth pine <unk> The trees huddled more closely together, 
their <unk> and leaves <unk> in a coarse curtain against 
the sun. <unk> and vines <unk> the rocks in forming <unk> <unk> 
for the <unk> stranger, and without the direct light of the sun to 
act as <unk> Pamela could no longer be positive of her <unk> she continued to move upward. She was sure she 
would reach the pool by <unk> and she clung to that belief despite 
the increasing number of <unk> The forest had become an alien 
world where she <unk> alone, <unk> <unk> to deal with whatever <unk> were <unk> It was a <unk> dark <unk> of pine <unk> 
that stood like a medieval <unk> <unk> the sun and human 
time. At one and the same time, she was within it but still searching 
for the <unk> that would give her <unk>   <unk> came into 
the <unk> a solid being that <unk> its hand over the <unk> <unk> of the birds and the whispered comfort of the trees. <unk> 
walked at <unk> side, its presence <unk> close, yet too far 
for her to hear. <unk> stood in front of her, <unk> and in back 
of her, <unk> her <unk>   She stumbled over the root of a <unk> that <unk> <unk> above the earth. In spite of her attempt 
to preserve her balance, she <unk> <unk> her arm on a naked <unk> 
For a moment, she could not catch her breath and then, her breath <unk> in short, frightened <unk> she lifted herself to her feet <unk> She started to brush the dirt and bits of leaves off her <unk> Her arm <unk> slightly, and the <unk> skin cried out in <unk>   She looked around. She was <unk> She seemed to 
have come such a long <unk> too far for her <unk> which had <unk> been swallowed up in the <unk> gloom of the trees. She stood 
quite still, trying to focus upon a direction in which to turn, a <unk> to <unk> a clue to guide her.   She was standing in a thick <unk> The trees were crowded so closely together that their branches <unk> virtually <unk> out the sun completely. The earth <unk> moist and <unk> as it might in a cave deprived of the <unk> 
effect of the <unk> <unk> She had the feeling that, under the <unk> <unk> there would be the bodies of dead animals, quietly <unk> 
and giving their soil back to the <unk>   The thought 
made Pamela <unk> A terrible chill swept through the <unk> Not 
a breeze <unk> but a pocket of icy air that settled with a <unk> <unk> upon the deep <unk> of the <unk> catching Pamela 
in a <unk> <unk> There was a peculiar density about it, a thick <unk> that could be sensed but never <unk> never actually <unk> before had she felt or <unk> or imagined such 
a <unk> She already knew this <unk> <unk> atmosphere that 
was somehow <unk> alive. It enclosed her <unk> hands and <unk> 
around her <unk> It crept into the open neck of her <unk> and <unk> down her body, <unk> into her flesh through all the quivering <unk> 
of her <unk> It crawled across her <unk> suffocating the life 
in her <unk> It circled her <unk> <unk> with its icy <unk> 
It entered her body with the ghastly <unk> of an <unk> and 
its particles, <unk> <unk> <unk> joined themselves into <unk> bands that <unk> her knees so tightly that they <unk> <unk> 
her lungs so that her breath came in harsh <unk> clutched her <unk> and <unk> up the moisture in her mouth so that her tongue was <unk> and hard and stuck to the roof of her mouth and her teeth were <unk> 
together in the rigid <unk> of her <unk>   She had to 
get away from here before this <unk> possession swallowed up the liquid 
of her eyes and sank into the fibers of her <unk> <unk> her 
of reason and sight. But she did not know which way to go. The shadows 
of the trees engulfed her, <unk> every possible <unk> from the <unk> She had been <unk> here by a <unk> <unk> that <unk> around 
her throat in <unk> circles.   She could not <unk> 
for even if a sound could take shape within her <unk> mouth, who 
would <unk> who would <unk>   Does the mountain <unk> groped <unk> She had to escape. She had to move in 
some <unk> any direction that would take her away from this evil <unk>   She thrust forward through the shadows and the trees

seemed <unk> <unk> <unk> cracked loudly under her <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> at her <unk> tree branches snapped

a pistol on his <unk> He had a legitimate reason for wearing it. It 
was <unk> for <unk> and he was packing a lot of money back into

the <unk> office had made no previous issue of it.   "So <unk> this all <unk> he <unk> when Lord confronted him. 
I'm not the only man in town with a gun, or the only one without

that he had virtually had to <unk> The deputy had forced him to

said. "Why single me out on this permit <unk>   "Well,

They were sitting on their heels, <unk> over by the still

and he was turning up his coat collar against the rain. It was 
not until he moved across the porch that he became aware of them, and 
then it was too late. They closed in fast, kept him from reaching inside 
his coat for his gun.   "Just come <unk> Brannon told 
him. "Don't start anything you can't <unk>   "Now, <unk> Macklin began.   "We'll talk over at your <unk> I warn you"! "Let's go, <unk> <unk> Brannon said, and took him by the arm.   Hogan gripped the <unk> other arm. They <unk> him down from the porch and through

all sides. No man laid a hand on him, but the threat of violence was 
there. His face took on a sudden <unk> became <unk> with <unk> and 
he seemed to have trouble with his <unk> He held out a moment <unk> then his nerve gave under the pressure.   He <unk> and 
said, "All right. It's here in my <unk>   "Get it out", <unk> ordered. Then, as Macklin <unk> "Now let's

followed him into the rain and across to the <unk> stone building fifty 
feet to the rear. The door of the <unk> was of <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
with <unk> <unk> It was secured by an <unk> <unk> Macklin <unk> again, not wanting to <unk> and open the door. They crowded 
him in that threatening way once more, forced him to give in. Once the 
door was open, they crowded him inside the dark building. He was <unk> <unk> in a low but savage voice when they closed and <unk>

He came to the edge of the <unk> peered down at them with his hand

and starting up the steps with his men following. "Don't get <unk> killed for something that doesn't concern you". 
He strode past the now frightened man, entered the house. <unk> and <unk> <unk> remained on the <unk> to keep <unk> from <unk> 
The others followed Brannon inside. They trailed him across 
the wide hallway to the <unk> four roughly <unk> and <unk> 
men who probably had never before <unk> into such a house. They brought 
to it all the <unk> that clung to men like themselves, that of their

of that room.   And their arrival caught John Clayton and 
Charles <unk> off <unk> author of the anonymous notes seemed to be <unk> For 
men who had left cattle alone after getting their first notices had 
received no second. But the day of the deadline came and passed, and 
the men who had <unk> at the warnings laughed with satisfaction. For, 
with a single <unk> nothing had happened to them.   The <unk> was an <unk> <unk> <unk> named William <unk> After 
walking out to his <unk> that morning, he'd been amazed to see the <unk> <unk> up in front of his feet. A split second later, the distant <unk> of a rifle had <unk> He'd mounted up immediately and raced 
with a revolver ready toward the spot from which he'd estimated the <unk> had come. But he had found all of the <unk> and points of <unk> deserted. There had been no sign of a <unk> and no track or <unk> to show that anyone had been <unk>   Lewis was a man who had 
made a full-time job of cow <unk> He hadn't even pretended to 
be farming his <unk> His land had never been <unk> He had done 
his rustling openly and boasted about it. He had received both first 
and second anonymous <unk> and each time he had accused his neighbors 
of writing them. He had cursed at them and threatened them. He was 
a man, those neighbors testified later, who didn't have a friend 
in the world.   William Lewis made the rounds of all who lived 
near him again, that August morning after a bullet landed at his feet, 
and once more he accused and threatened <unk>   "I'll 
be ready next <unk> he <unk> "I'll be <unk> right <unk> had his chance the very next morning, for exactly the

but he still refused to give up and move out.   "Just 
let me meet up with that damned <unk> <unk> <unk> 
he <unk> "That's all I <unk>   He never got that <unk> For the <unk> <unk> <unk> aimed a little higher the

to lift himself. Two more shots followed in quick <unk> dropping 
him limp and huddled on the ground.   An <unk> was held, and 
after a good deal of testimony about the anonymous notes, the county <unk> estimated that the shooting had been done from a distance of <unk> yards. <unk> of the offer Tom Horn had made at the <unk>

after the shooting and began preparing an <unk> But that indictment 
was never made. For Tom <unk> it turned out, had a number of <unk> and cowboy witnesses ready and willing to swear with straight <unk> that he had been in <unk> <unk> the day of the <unk>

giving his secret employers their <unk> <unk> A good many <unk> <unk> were accepting the death of William Lewis as proof 
that the warning notes were not idle <unk> The company <unk> were

wants to see her".   <unk> pulled up short, and turned <unk> don't know, Mr& <unk> he said <unk> 
beginning to get an <unk> of <unk> plans. "It doesn't seem 
quite right, telling her a thing like that. <unk> I <unk> 
His voice trailed off into silence.   <unk> continued to smile, 
but his eyes were cold. He turned and looked around at the lobby 
as though seeing things he hadn't before <unk>   "You know, <unk> he said <unk> <unk> <unk> ought to have 
a fire company. If someone were to drop a match in here, this place 
would go up like a <unk> He started toward the <unk> then 
turned to <unk> "Tell her to come to <unk> room, that Adams 
is in trouble. Tell her to <unk>   <unk> sir". His face <unk> <unk> headed for the street. <unk> visit to the <unk> stable had been merely a precaution in case anyone should be <unk> 
He paused only long enough to ascertain that Jess's <unk> 
was still missing and that his own gray was all right, then climbed 
through a back window and dropped to the ground outside.   The 
fact that Jess's horse had not been returned to its <unk> could indicate 
that <unk> information had been wrong, but Curt didn't interpret 
it this way. A man like Jess would want to have a ready means 
of escape in case it was needed. Probably his horse would be close 
to where he was <unk>   From the back of the barn it was a simple 
matter to reach Black's house without using the street. Curt 
approached the place <unk> and watched it several minutes from the <unk> of a <unk> of trees.   There was a light in Black's 
front room, but drawn curtains prevented any view of the <unk> <unk> circled the house and located a barn out back. He could hear <unk> moving around inside, and nothing else. There was no lock on the 
door, only an iron <unk> which he <unk> He opened the door and 
went in, pulling it shut behind him.   Again he stood in the darkness <unk> but there was only the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> on a <unk> 
floor. He moved ahead <unk> his left hand in front of him, 
and came to a wooden <unk> Horse smell was very strong, and he could 
hear the <unk> of grain being ground between strong <unk> He found 
a match in his pocket and lit it.   There were two horses in 
the barn, a <unk> <unk> and Jess <unk> <unk> Curt <unk> 
out the <unk>   It was certain now that Jess was in the house, 
but also, presumably, was <unk> <unk> Curt wanted to get Jess <unk> without interference from anyone, even as <unk> a person 
as the store <unk>   He studied the problem for a few seconds 
and thought of a means by which it might be <unk> <unk> across 
the side of the <unk> he slapped the <unk> on the <unk> The startled 
animal let out a terrified <unk> and <unk> around in the <unk> Curt had <unk> the house door <unk> open. He slapped 
the <unk> again and it kicked <unk> its <unk> <unk> the side of 
the <unk>   Curt moved over beside the door and waited. Presently 
he heard <unk> crossing the yard, and Jess's smothered <unk> 
The door swung open, and Jess said <unk> "What the <unk> 
the matter with <unk>   The horse continued to <unk> <unk> doubted that any animal belonging to Jess would find much reassurance 
in its <unk> voice.   Jess cursed again, and entered 
the <unk> A match <unk> and he reached above his head to light a lantern 
which hung from a wire <unk> As he crossed to the side of the <unk> Curt drew his gun and clicked back the <unk>   <unk> 
you try <unk> he said. "Remember what happened to <unk> caught his breath in <unk> He started to reach 
for his gun, but apparently thought better of it.   "That's 
the <unk> Curt said. "Just hold it that way". He reached out 
to pull the door shut and <unk> it with a sliding <unk> "You and 
I have a little talking to do, <unk> You won't be <unk> this". 
He moved up and lifted Jess's pistol out of its <unk> you, <unk> Jess was beginning to recover from his initial <unk> "We ain't got nothing to talk about. If I don't 
come back in the house, <unk> going <unk>   "Your <unk> <unk> isn't <unk> the house. About now he's probably 
having <unk> That long ride the four of you took <unk> given 
him a good <unk> Now turn around so I can see your <unk> <unk> There was raw fury in his eyes, and the <unk> of his <unk> were <unk>   "You're about as dumb as they come, <unk> 
I don't know what you're up to, but when <unk> can forget about <unk> too", Curt said. "It's <unk> <unk> we're going to talk <unk>   <unk> <unk> <unk> "I don't know <unk> about him". <unk> I suppose you don't know anything about a piece of <unk> <unk> one with blood all over it, <unk> <unk> <unk> fingers put a little more pressure on the trigger of his gun. 
"So help me, <unk> I'd like to kill you where you stand, but, 
before I do, I'm going to hear you admit killing him. Now start <unk> Who told you to do it? Was it Dutch <unk> was holding Jess's gun in his left hand. He drew back his 
arm to <unk> the <unk> across Jess's face, but didn't finish 
the <unk> <unk> an <unk> man might come easy to someone 
like <unk> but Curt couldn't bring himself to do it.   Apparently <unk> this, and realizing that it gave him an <unk> Jess 
became <unk>   <unk> all the guns makes you a big man, don't 
it, <unk> If we was both <unk> you wouldn't talk so <unk> Curt reached out and dropped Jess's pistol 
back into the <unk> He <unk> a step and <unk> his <unk> right, <unk> we're on even terms. Now <unk> <unk> out on Jess's <unk> face. The fingers of 
his right hand twisted into a <unk> but he didn't reach for the <unk> angry enough to be a little <unk> raised his hands <unk> high.   "Does this make it any <unk> <unk> ain't <unk> against you", Jess said <unk> "I 
heard how you <unk> <unk> I ain't a <unk>   "No. <unk> the kind of bastard who <unk> up on a man from behind 
and hits him with a club. I just wanted to hear you say <unk> stared at him without answering and let his hands fall to his <unk> He had found Curt's <unk> or what to Jess was a <unk> 
and was smart enough to take advantage of it.   Somewhere in 
the distance, a woman screamed. Curt was too involved in his own problems 
to pay much attention. He had to make Jess talk, and he had to 
do it before <unk> Black got curious and came to <unk> Once 
more he lifted Jess's gun from its <unk> only this time he tossed 
it into the <unk> with the frightened <unk> He dropped his own 
beside it.   "We'll do it another way, <unk> he said <unk> coarse features twisted in a surprised grin which 
was smashed out of shape by Curt's <unk> With a roar of pain 
and fury Jess made his attack.   Curt managed to <unk> beneath the <unk> <unk> <unk> and drove home a solid left to Jess's <unk> 
It was like hitting a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> up Curt's 
arm clear to the shoulder, but Jess seemed hardly aware that he had 
been hit. He slammed into the wall, bounced back, and caught Curt with 
a <unk> right which sent him <unk> An inch lower and it 
would have knocked him out. As it was, his vision <unk> and for a moment 
he was unable to move. When his eyes began to <unk> he saw Jess <unk> at him with a <unk>   Curt twisted to one side, 
and the <unk> of the fork bit into the floor. Jess wasted a few seconds 
trying to <unk> them <unk> It gave Curt time to <unk> to his <unk> <unk> broke off under Jess's <unk> and he swung 
the handle in an attempt to knock Curt's brains out. His aim was <unk> so the <unk> whistled over Curt's head.   By 
now Curt was seeing clearly again. He stepped inside Jess's guard 
and landed two <unk> to the big man's <unk> putting everything he 
had behind them. They made Jess double over. When his head came down, <unk> grabbed him by the hair and <unk> him head first into the <unk>   The building <unk> setting the lantern to <unk> and 
the <unk> to pitching again. Even Black's old <unk> began 
to <unk> and from the house Black yelled, <unk> What's going 
on out there"?   Jess didn't seem too sure himself. He <unk> <unk> to his feet, lowered his head, and took one step away 
from the wall. Curt caught him flush on the nose with a blow which 
started at the floor.   Jess had had enough. <unk> <unk> from 
his nose, and he backed off as rapidly as he could, stumbling over his 
own feet in his frantic haste to get away from Curt's <unk> was in almost as bad shape, but he wouldn't <unk> He backed <unk> into a corner, grabbed a handful of the man's <unk> and <unk> back his right <unk>   "Tell me about <unk> You <unk> him, didn't you"?   "It was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> at his nose. "He found out about you and <unk> <unk> He wanted to show the town what happened to anyone who

to the floor. Turning his back, Curt crossed to the <unk> reached 
over to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and waved his hand in the <unk> face.   The <unk> bolted out of the <unk> Curt 
moved in and picked up his gun. He shook loose straw out of the action, 
and placed the gun in his <unk> <unk> Jess's where it <unk> 
he left the <unk>   "Get up, <unk> We're going <unk> painfully got to his feet as someone <unk> the

and pointed his pistol at <unk>   "Get out of here. You're

to shut the door and <unk> it. Black would have little trouble getting 
out, but it might delay him a few minutes.   <unk> you <unk> me"? Jess asked <unk>   "We're going to <unk> <unk> house. Maybe if the <unk> hears this himself, <unk> make a difference.

something permanent to remember me <unk>   Sally left her <unk> 
to stand beside <unk> <unk> her hand in his, they silently watched 
the <unk> make the bend in the road and disappear from sight. 
Much as they had to look forward to, they didn't <unk> a moment 
of the time they spent seeing them go. <unk> <unk> <unk> 
could not believe her own eyes. She had spent too many hours looking <unk> hoping and longing to catch even a glimpse of Dan and finding 
nothing but <unk> And now she could see him, looking <unk> <unk> standing there beside Sally Jackson and her folks in front 
of their <unk> wagon.   Seeing them waiting there at the <unk> of <unk> Rock was so overwhelming that, for a good minute 
after they rounded the bend and started down the grade leading toward 
them, <unk> could not speak at all. Then, with a glory that almost <unk> out the deep, downward <unk> in her <unk> face, <unk> leaned 
over the wheel and shouted to <unk> who was stumbling along in the 
heat and the dust on the opposite side of the wagon <unk> <unk> 
I can see <unk> And he's with the <unk>   "What 
about <unk> <unk> asked, who still believed they'd have them

to think that they were all back together again. But even a reunion

they made circle, tended the cattle, <unk> the horses, gathered <unk> 
carried water, and started their cooking <unk> Then, and only then, 
with the <unk> and Dan as their true guests of honor, did the <unk> take time to catch up on the news. No sooner did they hear 
of <unk> injury than both Gran and <unk> went into immediate action. 
The wound in his <unk> was <unk> pronounced <unk> and well <unk> with <unk> before they <unk> up the <unk> From then 
on, in keeping with the traditions they had followed since childhood, 
the whole group settled down to <unk> their food. Even <unk> in <unk> of her <unk> and obvious <unk> followed the old <unk> of <unk>

At these words of sympathy and understanding, Harmony said <unk> 
"I don't mind setting here along with Gran while you go out and <unk> in the <unk>   Rod shifted his eager eyes from the milling 
group out in the circle long enough to reply, "I ain't much

While no larger than Dutch Springs, this mining supply town had 
the <unk> of being far <unk> and more <unk> Men crowded the streets 
and freight <unk> and teams were moving about. Although they were 
forced to maintain a <unk> watch, this activity enabled them to ride 
in and rack their <unk> without any particular attention being paid

their legs.   There were no less than six or seven <unk>

as <unk> and dull as the day before <unk> Carmer himself was nowhere 
to be seen.   A man knocked the <unk> ball about <unk>

to increase his <unk> <unk> a course straight for the house,

he had his answer a moment later.   <unk> this <unk> He ain't 
gone <unk> a harsh cry floated to him across the <unk> <unk> cracked more <unk> and a slug <unk> fragments from the <unk> off at one side. The would-be <unk> had his position figured 
pretty close. <unk> Russ looked about <unk> <unk> the <unk> this depression led toward a <unk> <unk> his <unk> he hurried 
that way, not <unk> till he was well below the level of the surrounding <unk>   <unk> up then, and <unk> forward over the <unk> he urged his mount down the <unk> <unk> He had not covered 
a hundred yards before a gun crashed from somewhere <unk> He had 
been <unk> and his <unk> pumping shot after shot. A shot or two 
went wild before Cobb felt something <unk> at his <unk> A slug had torn 
half of his <unk> away. A second <unk> his <unk> 
and he felt a brief burn on his upper arm. Another snarled close <unk> <unk> Let's get out of <unk> the first shot Russ had <unk> his mount to the left toward 
the side of the winding <unk> The long minute before he reached effective <unk> seemed <unk> <unk> a look around, he saw that he 
was safe for the moment. He heard <unk> from behind him, but he could 
make out no words.   He dashed <unk> for the next <unk> turn in 
the <unk> and made it. <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> into an <unk> <unk> he plunged forward with <unk> <unk> <unk> 
the wash climbed <unk> forcing him toward open range. Yet he must <unk> it. He <unk> out of the <unk> <unk> the loose dirt <unk> behind him, and flashed a look about. <unk> in November the clouds lifted enough to carry out the assigned <unk> And <unk> <unk> put its first marks on the combat <unk> Every plane that could fly was sent into the <unk> took eight ships and went south across the <unk> and along 
the north coast of <unk> to <unk> Anything the enemy flew 
or floated was his target. <unk> with eight was to patrol the <unk> <unk> area, with his main task to get any <unk> before they 
got to the ships. Greg himself took two <unk> with Todman leading 
the second, to patrol and look for targets of opportunities around <unk> on the east coast of <unk> Each plane carried two <unk> <unk> <unk>   A weapons <unk> took <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and the others the two miles from the <unk> area to the <unk> It was a rough long ride through the mud 
and pot holes. No one had much to say. The sky <unk> down at them. 
There was a feeling that this mission would be canceled like all the 
others and that this muddy wet dark world of combat would go on <unk> truck dropped them off at the various <unk> spread 
through the <unk> Donovan snatched Greg's <unk> from him with 
a <unk> motion and almost ran to the plane with it. His face was 
dark as the sky above it as he stood on the wing and waited for his <unk> Greg climbed into the cockpit feeling as if he had never been 
in one before. But his hands and those of Donovan moved automatically <unk> and arranging in the <unk> procedure.   "I've 
got her as neat as I <unk> Donovan said, as he dropped the <unk> 
of the <unk> <unk> over Greg's shoulders. "But this <unk> <unk> It's for <unk> not <unk>   "We'll make 
out. Don't you worry, <unk> Greg replied, wondering if he himself <unk> it.   <unk> See you", Donovan said as he jumped 
off the <unk> The expression was his <unk> his open <unk> to 
good luck, and his prayer that pilot and plane would always return. 
At the <unk> time, Greg started the engine and <unk> out. From 
the time the <unk> were pulled until the plane was out of sight, 
he knew Donovan would keep his back to the <unk> He wondered where 
the <unk> had originated that it was bad luck for a crew chief 
to watch his plane take off on a combat mission. Yet long before the <unk> time for return, Donovan would be watching for every <unk> 
in the sky.   Greg <unk> down the rough metal taxi <unk> and 
one by one the seven members of his flight fell in behind him. The dark <unk> bombs hanging under each wing looked large and <unk> The <unk> heads looked <unk> <unk> The control tower gave him 
immediate <unk> <unk> and the clean roar of the engine that 
took him off the rough strip spoke well of the skill of <unk> mission was the last to leave, and as he circled the ships 
off <unk> he saw the clouds were dropping down again. To the west, 
the dark green hills of <unk> were lost in the clouds about halfway 
up their <unk> <unk> him the sea was a dark and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> against his windshield as he led the flight in and 
out of <unk> The metal strip they had taken off from was coal black 
against the green jungle around it. He possessed the fighter <unk> <unk> of bad weather and instrument <unk> and he <unk> if 
the ceiling did <unk> whether he and the other flights would be able to 
find their way back in this unfamiliar territory. He <unk> in the 
warm cockpit.   The overcast was solid above him. As far as he 
could see there was no hole to climb through it. They would have to 
go west through the narrow river valley that separated <unk> from <unk> 
and hope that it didn't close in before they <unk>   Greg 
pushed the radio button on his <unk> <unk> let's try 
to go under this <unk> <unk> in close and we'll go up the <unk> <unk> Todman called back, and pulled his four 
in and slightly above <unk>   Greg took the formation wide 
around three <unk> attack bombers that were headed north over the <unk> 
He dropped down to five hundred feet, swinging a little north of 
the city of <unk> and <unk> into the opening that showed against 
the <unk>   The valley was only a few hundred yards wide 
with just about room enough for a properly performed <unk> <unk> It was only a <unk> <unk> but before it was 
through Greg felt 
himself developing a case of <unk> The ceiling 
stayed solid above them at about eight hundred feet, and at times 
the sheer <unk> seemed about to close in. If the other pilots were <unk> 
they did not show it. The formation remained <unk> 
When the sea was visible ahead of them, the relief was as great as if 
the sun had come out. He spread the flight out and led them across a 
point of land and then down the coast. Although they drew light ground 
fire they saw no signs of activity.   Once Todman thought he 
had spotted a tank and went down to investigate while Greg covered him. <unk> beat us to it"! Todman said over the radio as he 
came back up in <unk>   <unk> continued to be <unk> 
and Greg was never able to get above a thousand feet. It was <unk> 
His <unk> were constantly full of the sounds of enemy contacts 
made by other <unk> He thought once that he identified the somewhat <unk> voice of <unk> claiming a <unk> But Greg's 
area remained as <unk> as a Florida <unk>   Finally, as time 
began to run out, he headed into <unk> and <unk> a group of houses 
that <unk> had thought might contain Japanese supplies. 
The low clouds made <unk> difficult. There was not enough room to 
make the usual vertical bomb run. The accuracy was <unk> One 
of Greg's bombs hung up, and he was miles from the target before he 
could get rid of it. Only one of the flight scored a direct hit and 
the rest blew up <unk>   With their load of bombs gone, the planes 
moved swiftly and <unk> Greg went up tight against the ceiling 
and led them back to their pass to home. <unk> it was still open. 
Like a man making a deep <unk> Greg took full breath and plunged 
back into the valley. He was about to make a gas check on his flight 
when <unk> voice broke <unk> <unk> Three <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>   Greg's eyes <unk> up from his instrument <unk> He saw them, <unk> against the gray, but closing fast. 
They were headed straight for each other on a collision course. <unk> 
or <unk> The same old question. And only a few seconds to answer 
it.   <unk> Todman said <unk> and <unk> then he thought Todman might be right. His mind <unk> 
through the mental pictures he had from the hours of Aircraft <unk> 
He narrowed the shape down to <unk> either a <unk> or a U& 
S& Navy type aircraft.   If it were the enemy, <unk> 
his position was correct. Japanese aircraft were strong on <unk> 
American on speed and <unk> His present maximum <unk> 
up against the <unk> gave him the opportunity to exploit his <unk> But it also made him <unk> to the enemy, if it was 
the enemy, and he hadn't been spotted already. But the closing aircraft 
showed no sign of <unk> from their original course.   In <unk> Greg made his decision.   He pushed the radio <unk> <unk> <unk> hit the deck. <unk> of <unk> <unk> you take 
the one on the left. I'll take the <unk> <unk> the one on the <unk> If **h <unk> they're <unk> Let's make sure <unk> <unk> had the stick forward and the <unk> up before he heard the two <unk>   The <unk> light with most of the gas burned 
out, responded <unk> Greg's <unk> <unk> was over 350 
when he leveled off just above the trees. The opposing aircraft continued 
to come on. They appeared to be the enemy. Greg wished the Air <unk> had continued to <unk> <unk> There was, of course, no 
way for the other planes to get by them. It was a <unk> But they could 
turn and escape to the east.   Greg pushed the radio button again. <unk> drop your second element back. If any of us <unk> they 
can pick up the pieces. Now let's make sure they're <unk> as he said it, Greg knew they had found the enemy. The <unk> were <unk> and the <unk> <unk> were showing up, slightly <unk> <unk> in the gray <unk>   Greg slapped his hand 
across the switches that turned on the guns and gun camera and gun sight. 
The circle with the dot in the center showed up yellow on the <unk> <unk> in front of him. His hands <unk> <unk> your <unk> <unk> <unk> They're <unk> came a high-pitched <unk>   <unk> to <unk> <unk> One pass only. 
No <unk> You'll <unk> your <unk> in this <unk> That's an <unk> moved the flights over against one wall. It gave them 
all a chance to make a <unk> climbing turn attack and a <unk> 
that would not take them into the overcast or force a <unk> <unk> 
If the turn was too <unk> a barrel roll would bring them out. 
A hell of an <unk> for a barrel <unk> but it could be <unk> slammed his <unk> to the fire wall and <unk> up the <unk> 
and the engine responded as if it had been waiting. The clearly <unk> enemy continued on as if no one else were around. "They <unk> seen <unk> Greg yelled to himself over the engine <unk> 
"They haven't seen us". He hit the radio <unk> "Now, <unk> 
now. Let's take 'em home".   He hauled back on the <unk> and felt his <unk> <unk> Out of the corner of his eye, he watched 
his <unk> move out a bit and shoot up with him. <unk> he <unk> the rapid rate of <unk> the approach from below, 
the side, and ahead, there would be only a moment when damage could 
be done. Just like shooting at a <unk> while performing a <unk> 
from a <unk> board.   He <unk> his turn. His nose up. It 
was going to be <unk> Eight aircraft in this small <unk> <unk> <unk> God, make my pilots good, he <unk>   He took a lead on 
the enemy, using a distance of five of the <unk> in his circular sight 
and then added another. The enemy did not <unk> It did not seem possible 
that they hadn't been <unk> <unk> <unk>   <unk> fingers closed on the stick <unk> The plane <unk> 
and <unk> Six red lines <unk> their way into the gray and <unk> 
As if drawn by a wire the enemy flew into them. Greg <unk> his 
turn until the plane <unk> <unk> was with him. His burst held 
for a second on the engine section of the plane. The <unk> <unk> <unk> off in pieces. A large piece of engine <unk> <unk> It 
was all Greg had time to see. His <unk> for the shot had placed 
him near the <unk> almost <unk> and heading up into the <unk> 
His speed was dropping rapidly. If he spun out now, he would join 
his opponent on the ground.   <unk> stay clear, he <unk> He 
pushed stick and <unk> and entered the overcast on his back. He fought 
the panic of <unk> He had no idea which was up and which was <unk> He held the controls where they had been. <unk> popped out over 
him and he felt the <unk> between his palm and the stick <unk> His 
air speed dropped until he thought he would <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> humming of tires and <unk> 
of <unk> there was a charming melody of <unk> and tiny <unk> <unk> 
air moving slowly through the open or <unk> side windows hinted 
of blooming <unk> <unk> and occasionally a faint fragrance 
of perfume <unk> from the back seat.   <unk> my driver 
suddenly exclaimed with something so <unk> so final in his tone 
I 
once more repeated the <unk> <unk> all my latent powers of <unk> to sound <unk>   We were coming to an <unk> 
turning right, <unk> to a stop.   <unk> to realize that 
this was the end of a very short line I scanned a road <unk> and discovered

The straight, black hair flopped in a vigorous <unk> the slender nose <unk> toward glass teeth and drew safely back.   Johnson <unk>

were in a field, in a <unk> screeching turn. Prairie dogs were <unk>

back at me, the driver released a <unk> of Spanish in which <unk> 
appeared every so often like an island in the <unk> waves of <unk> sound. I <unk> my head each time it appeared.   Suddenly 
the Spanish became an English in which only one word emerged 
with clarity and <unk> <unk> of a <unk> sometimes <unk> 
by vicious <unk> of a beer bottle into Johnson's quivering <unk> big car was <unk> its <unk> teeth <unk> Beyond

probably only a fraction of <unk> the bottle this time 
went to the <unk> lips.   Another car was coming, a tiny,

In the <unk> sand was white and <unk> only an occasional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> But Johnson couldn't quickly <unk> the truck door, and if I <unk> he might <unk> 
The car was approaching fast. On the truck bed there was nothing smaller 
than a piece of rusty <unk> with more time I could have <unk> a small <unk> or <unk> <unk>   Suddenly and not a second 
too soon I thought of the <unk> in my pocket. There was no time to <unk> out a <unk> I got a coin between my thumb and <unk> leaned 
my <unk> in a very natural and casual manner on top of the truck <unk> and <unk> my little missile.   There was a <unk> just under 
my focus of vision, a <unk> the car's far windshield panel turned 
into a silver <unk> with a dark hole in the center.   I heard 
the <unk> of <unk> behind me, an insane burst of laughter beneath me. <unk> back I saw a <unk> man getting out of his halted car 
and trying to read our license number.   <unk> Johnson's <unk> hand, another bottle were <unk> from the truck <unk>

The <unk> arm whipped <unk> there was a flash of <unk> 
and <unk> the crash of the bottle <unk> against the side of

wanted me to do was go to <unk> house and "do whatever detectives <unk> and get her <unk> and <unk> containing her identification. 
She realized I'd have to notify the police, but <unk> <unk> I could avoid mentioning her name.   Her impact in the <unk> commercials had led to her being considered for an excellent 
part in an <unk> ~TV <unk> <unk> Western <unk> a <unk> show to be sponsored by <unk> <unk> But if Joyce 
got involved in murder or <unk> <unk> the role would probably 
go to the <unk> wife, Mrs& <unk> <unk> Or at least not

for me to do them, but in <unk> Western <unk> I'd 
have a chance to <unk> I could show what I can <unk> ## <unk> far as I was concerned, she had already and had <unk> shown what 
she could do. But I promised Joyce I would mention her name, if 
at all, only as a last <unk> <unk> much <unk> she smiled one 
of those <unk> <unk> and I smiled all the way into the <unk> There I got my <unk> Special and shoulder <unk> slipped 
my coat on, and went back into the front room.   Joyce <unk> 
a little on the <unk> "I'm starting to <unk> she <unk>   "Yes, I'm still all covered with that <unk> I was loaded with suds when I ran away, and I haven't had a <unk> to wash it off. <unk> it sure <unk>   "You might

and <unk> and she said, <unk> "If you really don't mind, I think 
I'll get clean in the <unk> then <unk> for a few minutes in your <unk> That always <unk> me. <unk> it you"?   "Only 
when I do it". I shook my head. One of my virtues or <unk> is 
a sort of three-dimensional imagination complete with sound effects and <unk> living color. <unk> **h as long as you want, <unk> It'll 
probably be at least an hour or two before I can check back with

"Well, <unk> I said.   <unk> You'd better <unk> you can count on that".   She smiled slightly. <unk> <unk> "Don't hurry <unk> much. I'll be soaking

But suddenly those <unk> eyes seemed to have everything but <unk> 
of bees in them. However, when there's a job to be done, I'm 
a <unk> of grim <unk> I like to think. I spun about 
and <unk> through the front room to the door. As I went out, I 
could hear water pouring in the <unk> Hot water. She wouldn't be 
taking a cold <unk> Hell, she <unk>   <unk> <unk> Drive 
is only two or three miles from the <unk> and it took me less than 
five minutes to get there. But the scene was not the quiet, calm scene 
I'd expected. Four cars were parked at the <unk> and two of them 
were police radio cars. <unk> <unk> in the big house and surrounding <unk> I followed a <unk> gravel path alongside the 
house to the pool. Two uniformed officers, a couple of <unk> 
I knew, and two other men stood on a gray <unk> area next to the <unk> on my left. At the <unk> far end was the little <unk> Joyce 
had mentioned, and on the <unk> surface floated scattered <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> A few yards beyond the group of men, 
a man's nude body lay face down on a patch of thick green <unk> <unk> one of the <unk> spotted 
me and said, <unk> <unk> and walked toward me. <unk> you 
hear about this <unk> I grinned, but ignored the question. He didn't <unk> it; <unk> worked out of Central <unk> and we'd 
been friends for years.   He filled me in. A call to the police 
had been placed from here a couple of minutes after nine <unk> 
and the first police car had arrived two or three minutes after that- 
10 minutes ago now. <unk> at the <unk> in addition to the dead 
man, who was indeed Louis <unk> had been <unk> partner Bill <unk> and <unk> <unk> an advertising agency executive who handled 
the <unk> account. Neither of them, I <unk> had been present 
at the <unk> session earlier.   "What were they doing here"? 
I asked <unk>   "They were supposed to meet <unk> 
at nine p&m& for a conference concerning the ad campaign for their <unk> a new angle based on this <unk> <unk>   "Yeah,

he arrived here a couple minutes before nine and spotted <unk> in 
the water, got a <unk> pole from the <unk> <unk> and started <unk> him <unk> many people think that the primary purpose of a higher education 
is to help you make a <unk> this is not so, for education offers 
all kinds of <unk> including how to pull the wool over a husband's 
eyes while you are having an affair with his wife. If it were 
not for an old professor who made me read the classics I would have 
been <unk> on what to do, and now I understand why they are <unk> 
those who wrote them knew people and what made people <unk> worked for my Uncle <unk> Uncle by marriage so you will not think 
this has a mild <unk> of <unk> who ran one of those antique <unk> in New <unk> <unk> <unk> the old French <unk> The <unk> I had with him was to work four hours a day. The rest 
of the time I devoted to painting or to those other activities a young 
and healthy man just out of college finds <unk>   I had 
a <unk> studio which overlooked an ancient courtyard filled with <unk> and plants, blooming <unk> in the southern sun. I had 
come to New Orleans two years earlier after graduating college, partly 
because I loved the city and partly because there was quite a noted 
art colony there. When my Uncle offered me a part-time job which 
would take care of my normal expenses and give me time to paint I <unk> arrangement turned out to be <unk> I loved the 
city and I particularly loved the <unk> and spirit of <unk> <unk> 
I had seen two of them and we would soon be in another <unk> <unk> celebration with <unk> in the <unk> and, when you took a walk 
you never knew what adventure or pair of <unk> eyes were waiting 
around the next corner. The very faces of the people bore this expectation 
of fun and pleasure. It was as if they could hardly wait to get 
into their costumes, cover their faces with <unk> and go <unk> Uncle and I were not too close socially because 
of the difference in our ages. Sometimes I wondered vaguely what he 
did about women for my <unk> by blood, had died some years ago, but neither 
of us said anything. One Monday morning I saw him approach the <unk> with a woman and introduce me to her as my new <unk> They were 
married over the <unk> though he was easily sixty and she could 
not have been even <unk> She looked more like twenty-five or <unk> 
It was really a May and December <unk>   My new Aunt 
was perhaps three or four years older than I and it had been a long 
time since I had seen as <unk> a woman who <unk> sex. There was 
something about the <unk> of her face, her smile that was like New <unk> <unk> the way she held her head, the way she <unk> there 
was scarcely anything she did which did not <unk> me. Her legs 
were the full, <unk> kind, full <unk> like a rare wine and just as <unk> to the <unk> the <unk> was <unk> the ankle <unk> must forgive me if I seem to dwell too much on her 
physical aspects but I am an artist, accustomed to studying the physical 
body. The true artist is like one of those scientists who, from 
a single bone can reconstruct an <unk> entire body. The artist looks 
at an <unk> a <unk> a <unk> and, in his mind's eye, the clothes 
drop away and he sees her as she really is. And that is the way I 
first saw her when my Uncle brought her into his antique <unk> she impressed me instantly was <unk> I was aware that when 
our eyes met we both quickly <unk> them. I thought I saw a faint <unk> of color rise to her neck and quickly <unk> her <unk> True, 
she was my <unk> married to an Uncle related to me only by marriage, 
but why she had married a man twice her age, and more, perhaps, I 
did not know or much care.   She was standing with her back to 
the glass door. Her form was <unk> and with the strong light I 
could see the outlines of her body, a body that an artist or anyone 
else would have <unk> As it is in so many affairs of the heart, a 
man and a woman meet and something <unk> Something clicked in this <unk> but I treated her <unk> and I felt that she knew 
it, for we both kept our distance.   When she appeared at the store 
to help out for a few hours even my looking at her was <unk> <unk> my Uncle notice it. And then I became aware that she, too, <unk> at me <unk> I felt that her eyes were <unk> me 
as if she were a painter and I a nude model. I dismissed these feelings 
as wishful thinking but I could not get it out of my head that 
we had a strong physical attraction for one another and we both feared 
to dwell on it because of our relationship. When our eyes met the air 
was filled with an <unk> message of <unk> <unk> You have probably <unk> this. It is nothing you can put your fingers on but 
the air suddenly fills with a high charge of <unk>   Why 
she married him I do not know. I myself was fond of him but what a 
young woman half his age saw in him was a mystery to me. He already 
had that slow pace that comes over the <unk> while she herself had 
all the signs of one who <unk> the joys of living. <unk> with 
my <unk> she found a measure of economic security that she <unk> 
or maybe she liked men old enough to be her <unk> some women with 
father <unk> do.   For several weeks we eyed one another 
almost like <unk> <unk> and then one day Uncle was slightly <unk> 
and stayed <unk> his bride opened the store. I was waiting 
in front of it when she showed up and told me of my <unk> <unk> 
Even as she was telling me about it I became aware of a <unk> <unk> that <unk> her neck and moved <unk> to her cheeks, and <unk> I realized that when she entered the store she did 
not switch on the <unk> The <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> to her hard heels as she walked directly to the office in the <unk> and took the seat at his desk. She placed her <unk> fingers <unk> on the desk in an odd gesture as if to say, "Now, what <unk> was aware of a <unk> look in her eyes that told me 
the time was <unk> There was little likelihood of any customers 
walking in at that hour. I was standing beside her, watching the <unk> <unk> and wondering about the old <unk> <unk> against the wall 
on which he sometimes <unk>   I bent and kissed the still pink <unk> and suddenly she jumped up, and her two arms <unk> me in 
a <unk> <unk> Her mouth, which had been so much in my <unk> 
was warm and moist and <unk> I heard her <unk> <unk> better <unk> the <unk>   It did not take me long to slip the bolt <unk> 
and return to the rear and its <unk>   When we opened the 
door again for business and switched on the lights she <unk> will not always be <unk>   "I know. I was thinking 
about that. How will we work it <unk>   "I don't <unk> she said. "You're the man. You figure it out. I've <unk> the way you've been looking at me ever since we <unk> guess we both felt it". I said.   "I guess <unk> 
she said.   "But now what"?   Even as I said it I 
realized that an education can be <unk>   "I know what 
we can <unk> I said. "Tell him I made a pass at you".   She 
raised a protesting hand with a startled air.   "What are 
you trying to do? Get thrown <unk> If I even hint at it do you think 
it will matter that you are his <unk> and not even a blood <unk> don't want to be thrown out and I don't think 
I will. I think I have a way so we can carry on without his <unk> <unk>   "By telling him you are making passes at me"? 
she said <unk>   "When I was in <unk> I <unk> "I remember a poem I had to read in my lit class. I don't 
even remember who wrote it but it was one of those 15th or <unk> century <unk> In those days poems often told a story in verse and those 
boys had some <unk> to <unk> and now I think we can use the knowledge 
they passed on to us. <unk> <unk> <unk> opens <unk> 
A lot of people will <unk> the streets in costumes and <unk> and having 
a ball. There will be <unk> and <unk> If you tell him I 
made a pass at you he might think you misunderstood something I said 
or did, so instead of just telling him I made a pass, say I tried to 
date you and that you agreed so you could prove to him what a <unk> 
I really am. We made a rendezvous tomorrow evening at nine on some street 
near Lake <unk> And to prove what you tell him about 
me you suggest that he keep the date instead. You are both the same size. 
He could use your clothes for a costume and a heavy veil for a <unk> 
When I show up he will know you are a good wife to have told him 
about it".   "But you"- she began.   "Don't <unk> about me. It will turn out all right".   "I don't <unk> 
she <unk> "Are you trying to cut your <unk> I <unk> "I'm just beginning to collect <unk> 
on my investment in <unk>   As we expected, on 
the following day my Uncle was completely <unk> and opened the store 
as usual at 10 in the morning. I felt that he looked at me <unk> 
and <unk> and seemed to be uncertain what his attitude towards 
me should be, but he did not say one word which might indicate that 
he had been told of advances to his wife.   I quit work at my usual <unk> as if this day was no different from other days. I heard subsequently 
that my Uncle and Aunt had dinner in a nearby restaurant in 
the French <unk> after which he went home to get into his costume 
to keep the date. Shortly before nine I drove my <unk> to the street <unk> the Lake and parked the car in shadows far enough away from 
the rendezvous corner but near enough to keep the corner in clear view. 
A few minutes later I saw my <unk> car drive up and a woman's 
figure emerge and walk to the corner. I must say the figure was 
well made up. If it were not that I knew who it was I could have mistaken 
it for my Aunt so well did her clothes fit him. In one hand he <unk> firmly a <unk> though there had been no indication of rain. 
I suspected why he brought it along.   In the half darkness I 
approached <unk> making sure he did not see me. He was looking 
out on the dark waters of the Lake when I came upon him and without <unk> words I <unk> him hard across the face.   "You cheap <unk> I <unk> "You <unk> no good, <unk> <unk> 
You get a good, loyal <unk> <unk> and you fall for a pass 
by his own <unk> You <unk> <unk> be ashamed of yourself. 
He had better write a postcard to <unk> He opened the myth book again 
and there <unk> the margin next to Robert <unk> imaginative <unk> of the creation of the <unk> from <unk> <unk> 
were the names of four <unk> bars and Meredith <unk> address. 
The bars were marked as Walter had marked them in a small black 
book kept in a nearly secret <unk> The <unk> which had probably 
something to do with sex or some other interest, Nicolas was determined 
to find out and put to use. A card to Walter would get him an introduction 
to this <unk> and that might be good for something. Nicolas 
called on his <unk> a line came <unk>   <unk> 
man, and all <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>   That <unk> 
to draw a <unk> Nicolas <unk> as he stored the line away on the <unk> tape that was his mind.   And indeed, his postcard did draw 
from Walter a letter recommending his friend, the poet Nicolas <unk> 
to his friend Meredith <unk> Five days later, on receiving it, <unk> sat <unk> his <unk> on his writing table. <unk> he <unk> cried.   His hand was large and square and heavily <unk> 
The voice crying in him was the voice of guilt. His four weeks 
in Italy had turned into nearer three months. He had returned to the <unk> a week ago. Now, he was just in the late poems of <unk> 
and therefore had most of the nineteenth century before him- plus 
next <unk> class <unk> He was determined to spend an <unk> summer. Well, maybe <unk> wouldn't <unk> <unk> <unk> slowed and stopped over a line before him: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> The menace of <unk> gradually faded 
as Meredith asked himself should he translate it, <unk> the dark <unk> <unk> or, more <unk> <unk> <unk> witches are <unk> And he missed the point that the <unk> witches might 
be laughing at him for hoping to escape Nicolas <unk>   But <unk> too, was being <unk> that morning.   Not by the <unk> sun which had spread a warmth around his spot of grass in the 
English Gardens and sent him off to <unk> but by a blond girl in 
a sweater and skirt who stood a few yards off and <unk> regarded 
him. Should she wake him? She didn't have the heart. Her heart, 
her <unk> feeling, in fact her **h her being was too busy expressing <unk> as quietly <unk> by this sight of her Nicolas curled asleep 
under a <unk> in a park like a scene from <unk> She was just 
not able to break the <unk> <unk> she have been able to had she

To this <unk> <unk> Nicolas had replied, <unk> I can 
use this <unk> And when you get off this job tonight, well, you 
can <unk> something to <unk> And, as a matter of fact, Nicolas had <unk> in the park only part of one night, when he discovered that <unk> 
early mornings even in summer are <unk> with <unk> He had always 
known how to find a bed, and on his own terms. He used the blanket 
for late morning <unk> when hosts of the night had gone off to jobs 
and proved reluctant to leave him in their small rooms with their few <unk> Mary Jane <unk> knew none of <unk> Her Nicolas lay <unk> in the sun like a <unk> black hair falling over his eyes. She 
was telling herself that this might just be her reward at the end of 
a long meaningful search for truth. This was surely a reunion in art, 
it was all that poetry <unk>   That long night with Nicolas 
and <unk> in <unk> had opened her eyes. His advice, his voice 
saying his poems, the fact that he had not so much as touched her- 
on the contrary, he had put his head back and she had <unk> <his> <unk> this was all new. Her eyes had opened, she had caught a glimpse 
of a new faith.   The next day he was gone.   Mary Jane 
might not be the most intelligent woman, but she was one of the most <unk> Even so, it took her several days to force Walter to tell 
her <unk> <unk> <unk> a small <unk> <unk> 
her husband whom she found in <unk> Bar that she was taking a train 
to Germany to get away for a while, <unk> his arm, refusing a <unk> getting on the <unk> all this had only taken her two hours. 
She had arrived this morning and come straight to the English <unk> <unk> <unk> Walter had finally said, <unk> writes me that he

to teach <unk> freedom from the <unk> of needs such as <unk> the meaning

sat down at his place and, as always, began <unk> the young <unk> He was asking had it been she who left the love note in his <unk> <unk> also served as <unk> when he saw the <unk> followed 
by a <unk> blond girl approaching his table. It would be literary <unk> calculated to <unk> life to say that he, oh, dropped his <unk> 
so startled was he by Mary <unk> beauty. Yet he did drop 
his <unk> with the ordinary country girl as much in <unk> to the <unk> as <unk> that here, indeed, was something special. <unk> Jane had made very little effort. Above a dark green skirt 
she wore a pale green <unk> sweater with, as he soon <unk> no <unk> <unk> Her white blond hair was clean and brushed long straight

made her lips <unk> but no <unk> than usual. The result was grace

the whole idea before they started. Actually, she had hated him before 
she ever saw him. It had been five days too late before he learned 
that she'd gone through the wedding ceremony in a <unk> of <unk> administered by her mother.   The bitterness of their <unk> night still <unk> within him like an open <unk> She had jumped 
away from his shy touch like a cat confronted by a <unk> He 
had left her <unk> thinking familiarity would gentle her in time. 
But each mile <unk> she had hated him the <unk>   He stared 
at the <unk> turning it over and over in his wide, <unk> hands. 
"I <unk> he muttered, "I can sell the outfit for enough 
to send you home to your <unk> once we find a <unk> try to be <unk> Her laugh was hard. "They 
wouldn't 
have sold me in the first place if <unk> been food enough to 
go <unk>   He <unk> <unk> they didn't sell you", 
he said <unk> "They knew I was a good <unk> farmer back 
in Carolina, but out West was a chance to build a real farm of our <unk> They thought it would be a chance for you to make a life out where 
nobody will be thought any better than the next except for just what's 
inside of them. Without money or property, what would you have 
had at <unk> <unk>   "I might have <unk> but at least 
I wouldn't be <unk> to a crisp and <unk> with <unk> darkened under his heavy <unk> His blue eyes sought the <unk> 
sea of <unk> ahead.   To his <unk> there suddenly was 
no <unk> The valley lay clear, and open to the eye, right up to the <unk> 
line of <unk> <unk> hills that formed the horizon twenty 
miles ahead. <unk> he noticed the clouds racing upon them- heavy, <unk> <unk> clouds that formed even as they <unk> over the <unk> 
of the surrounding hills. He had never seen clouds like them before, 
but he had the primitive feel of danger that gripped a man before 
a hurricane in <unk>   He <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
and <unk> the oxen as he <unk> He wanted to turn them, putting 
the wagon against the storm. Too late, he realized that in <unk> 
he had wheeled them onto a patch of <unk> ground, instead of atop a <unk> or <unk>   He swung up over the wheel. "You had better 
get <unk> he warned her.   But she sat on in stubborn <unk> clouds <unk> downward and burst suddenly into a great 
black <unk> <unk> they stared at it whirling down the valley, <unk> and <unk> out <unk> and <unk> of earth like a <unk> <unk> dog cracking <unk> The <unk> <unk> began to whip 
and <unk>   Their world turned <unk> It was filled with dust 
and wind and sound and violence. The heavens opened, <unk> them with <unk> the size of <unk> And then came the <unk> not rain, but 
solid sheets that <unk> down like water <unk> from a <unk> <unk> 
of water rushed down the <unk> and filled the <unk> like the <unk> 
of flash <unk> Through the <unk> of the rising <unk> they could 
hear the roar of the river as it raged through its <unk> <unk> 
big <unk> out of the <unk>   The <unk> <unk> surface of 
the river reached the level of the <unk> The dangerous current upon 
the prairie <unk> but the water stood and kept on <unk> They <unk> 
under <unk> <unk> listening to the waves <unk> against the <unk> <unk> cut off <unk> They were engulfed by 
the weird silence, broken only by the low, angry <unk> of the river. 
Then the darkness <unk> and there was light again, and then bright <unk>   <unk> with fear and sound and wet and <unk> they <unk> to the hurricane deck and looked out <unk> at a world of water 
that reached clear to the surrounding hills. The water level was 
higher than their <unk> Only the heavy bones of the oxen kept them <unk> was no real sign of the river now, just a <unk> <unk> ribbon of liquid movement through muddy waters that reached everywhere. <unk> of brush rode down the <unk> Now and then, the glistening 
side of a <unk> object showed as it swept <unk> girl crawled out into the <unk> warmth of the <unk> <unk> 
her shoulders and still trembling. Her face was pale but set and 
her dark eyes <unk> with blame for <unk>   Out of compulsion 
to say something <unk> Ben Prime <unk> "Well, we were lucky 
to be on soft ground when the first <unk> hit. At least, the wheels <unk> in. The soaking will put life back in the wagon, <unk> wife didn't give a sign she'd heard. She was watching a <unk> ride wildly down that <unk> <unk> Somebody was riding the <unk> It raced closer and they could see a woman with white hair, sitting <unk> an upright <unk>   She did not call out. But as 
the tree passed, she lifted an arm in gesture of better luck and <unk> 
They watched the tree until it twisted sharply on a <unk> It <unk> 
up into the air, then sinking back, the <unk> branch turned <unk> The pale <unk> of the woman disappeared.   "There's 
the one who's <unk> the girl murmured <unk>   <unk> 
eyes strained with the bitter <unk> his homely face slashed with gray 
and <unk> Then he took off his wet boots and dropped down into 
the water to talk with the <unk> <unk> their comfort more than they 
needed his.   It was nearly <unk> and he went to the back of 
the wagon, <unk> his way, for he was not a tall man. He let 
down the <unk> and was knocked over by the <unk> of water. 
He <unk> back to his feet and scrambled <unk> to pull his bags of <unk> grain forward. They were already swollen to <unk> Of all 
their worldly <unk> next to the oxen and his gun, the seed grain had been 
the most <unk> It was <unk> now for <unk> and it would <unk> 
and mold in three days if they failed to find a place and fuel to dry 
it. The oxen might as well enjoy it.   He examined the water marks 
on the iron tires when the animals were finished. The waters lay <unk> but <unk> without a <unk> of movement against the <unk> there 
was not a <unk> of damp mark to show they were <unk> doubted if a man could <unk> as far as the <unk> dry hills 
that <unk> the valley. A <unk> <unk> sense of futility swept 
over him.   He gripped the wheel hard to fight the <unk> of <unk> Then he noticed that the dry wood of the wheels had <unk> 
The <unk> were tight again, the iron tires gripped onto the wheels 
as if of one piece.   Hope surged within him. He swung toward 
the front 
to give the news to <unk> then stopped, barred from her by 
the <unk> of her blame and <unk> Still, he felt better. A tight <unk> meant so much. <unk> got a small fire started and put on <unk> 
and coffee. He poured the water off the <unk> and off the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> of a <unk> Their <unk> and <unk> had not <unk> He found a jar of preserved <unk> 
and one of eggs that they had meant to <unk> Now he broke them open, <unk> a good meal might <unk> this depression <unk> <unk> long nose <unk> at the smells of <unk> <unk> and heating <unk> but the fire was low, and he wanted to waste no time. He <unk> the slashed sides of the canvas <unk> leaving the ribs and <unk> open.   He looked <unk> at his wife's <unk> holding 
her meager <unk> He said <unk> <unk> I don't 
figure your things got wet too much. That's a good <unk> If you 
want to get them <unk> **h"   She said without turning her head, <unk> that rain beating in atop the dust, there isn't a thing 
that won't be <unk>   He drew a long breath and opened 
the <unk> and hung out her clothes and <unk> upon the wagon <unk> oil, and <unk> make the kind of <unk> any <unk> dreams <unk> I suppose a <unk> <unk> had sneaked a cigarette in the hold 
and touched off the <unk> Now, roaring up in great <unk> clouds of <unk> and <unk> the fierce heat quickly drove us to the stern where 
we huddled like suffocating <unk> not knowing what to do **h. 
The <unk> were stuck fast. We couldn't <unk> them. I heard a 
cry from a <unk> as a <unk> of flame leaped from a <unk> and <unk> 
the man's bare back. He <unk> to the rail and leaped overboard 
into the <unk> waters.   One especially bad <unk> 
shook <unk> No& 3 which <unk> violently in the <unk> Brassnose <unk> "Come on, <unk> Max **h <unk> on it, we got 
a chance <unk> <unk> on those <unk> the <unk> come <unk> pulled and swore and <unk> and <unk> scraping our hands until 
they <unk> <unk> The <unk> was quivering and <unk> 
like an old <unk> <unk> Her stern was down and a sharp list helped 
us to cut loose the <unk> which dropped heavily into the <unk> Max and I leaped into the sea and swam to the <unk> "Let's get away <unk> said <unk> shaking water from 
his <unk> of <unk> hair. "That tub is going to explode all at <unk> the <unk> seemed to <unk> with a <unk> of live <unk> <unk> of sparks and <unk> and a dense cloud of <unk> smoke. <unk> we heard the voices of men in mortal <unk> but we couldn't go back into that <unk>   Already our <unk> <unk> was filled with five inches of water. <unk> you <unk> while we <unk> Brassnose <unk>   As best as I could <unk> we were some <unk> miles west of New <unk> in the <unk> <unk> Three days <unk> we had steamed past <unk> <unk> Island in the distance. Now we peered anxiously for any <unk> 
of land in the <unk> for this <unk> <unk> would have 
to stop soon. There were gigantic <unk> and rope burns on our <unk> 
our muscles were hot <unk> of pain.   Brassnose was strangely <unk> The big man with the <unk> hair murmured <unk> his 
words sounded as if they were in the <unk> <unk> which I <unk> 
having studied the <unk> in my <unk> <unk> class at the 
University of Chicago.   He then said something which struck 
a <unk> in my memory.   "God help us if we're near the island 
of <unk> We'd be in real trouble then. I'd rather keep <unk> 
or <unk>   I was puzzled by the <unk> then I recalled 
the voice of mild Professor Howard <unk> three years ago in a <unk> lecture on primitive societies. He had been speaking of this <unk>   <unk> when the islands were under German <unk> before World War /1,, <unk> gave <unk> a wide <unk> 
The place is <unk> by several hundred <unk> women who are <unk> of the Twentieth <unk> stone age <unk> who live 
in an <unk> <unk> society which is <unk> remembered, too, the <unk> voice of a <unk> Bobby <unk> 
"But how do they <unk> Dr& <unk> I'm sure that <unk> have something to do with that <unk>   There had 
been classroom <unk> which quickly <unk> as Professor <unk> said <unk> "I see your point, <unk> Of course, males play a role 
there, but believe me when I say you wouldn't enjoy yourself one 
bit on <unk> Indeed, you wouldn't live long, for the females 
either drive the men they've seized from neighboring islands back 
to their boats after <unk> them for <unk> purposes, or they destroy 
them by <unk> but ingenious methods. In fact, one important 
aspect of their very religion is the <unk> of <unk>   "I 
think I know what you mean, <unk> I said. "I know something 
about <unk> Let's hope we come to a <unk> <unk> we didn't. Three hours later, while we were <unk> <unk> 
a dot of land came into view. Foster <unk> <unk> made a 
sign over his heart with his two linked <unk> I recognized it as 
an ancient <unk> gesture intended to <unk> the <unk>   A <unk> <unk> we had drifted closer. In a voice so frightened as 
to seem not his own, the big <unk> mate <unk>   <unk> 
It <is> <unk> look hard, you can see with your <unk> eye the wooden <unk> on the <unk>   I <unk> 
at the looming <unk> There <was> a wooden tower or <unk> there, 
something like a <unk> <unk> it was perhaps 80 feet high and had 
been <unk> constructed of <unk> A fine example of engineering in 
a primitive society.   "What is the <unk> for, <unk> made a sound of despair deep in his throat. It was <unk> to see <unk> blonde Brassnose <unk> himself like 
a child who talks about <unk>   <unk> It is their <unk> the <unk> <unk> of death. It is the last of the 
three tests of <unk> which the women <unk> to discover if a male 
in worthy of survival there. <unk> I heard my <unk> and cousins speak 
of it when I was a small boy growing up in <unk> They had never 
seen a <unk> but they had heard about it from <unk> <unk> <unk> was filling rapidly and despite what I had 
heard of the inhabitants of <unk> I was glad to see a long and <unk> <unk> manned by three <unk> girls <unk> out of a lagoon 
into the open sea and toward our <unk>   I expected <unk> 
as a man with a strain of <unk> in his <unk> to speak to 
them. But he had turned a <unk> green and appeared <unk> or <unk> I <unk> my few words of the <unk> <unk> and 
said, "We greet you in peace. In <unk> My friends and I 
come from a ship which was destroyed by fire. We are <unk> and <unk> 
our sore and burned hands and arms need <unk>   The 
girl in the <unk> of the <unk> turned a smile like a <unk> on me. 
I noted that her full <unk> were bare and that she wore a <unk> 
of red <unk> fruit in her <unk> hair.   She said, "My 
name is <unk> and these girls are <unk> and <unk> You are welcome 
to <unk> My people await you on the shore. You shall have <unk> water and <unk>   <unk> minutes later, the <unk> <unk> 
on sand and other girls, waiting on <unk> rushed forward to pull 
it up on the beach and make it fast with <unk> <unk> to a large <unk> 
I saw a dozen or so other <unk> <unk> there.   I <unk> 
All my rosy visions of rest and even pleasure on this island vanished 
at the sight. There was a mound of <unk> human bones and <unk> 
at the base of the big wooden <unk> Some had been there for years; 
others still had <unk> <unk> of <unk> flesh sticking to <unk> was one object which <unk> yet fascinated me. This 
was also a <unk> a <unk> judging from the <unk> arm <unk> the <unk> scars still <unk> on the <unk> face, the painted bone of 
the <unk> <unk> which still <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> body may have been two or three <unk> dead. I looked 
with <unk> at the legs. They were <unk> Many small bones <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of flesh. The man must have leaped to 
his death from the <unk> <unk> of the <unk>   As if <unk> 
my <unk> the girl <unk> smiled warmly and said in the casual 
tone an American woman might use in describing her rose <unk> is our <unk> a jumping <unk> <unk> Later, 
you shall know it better. Is it not <unk> Our old one blew 
down in a storm at the time of the <unk> festival fifteen <unk> <unk> It took thirty of our women almost six <unk> to build this one, 
which is higher and stronger than the old one. We are very proud of <unk>   "You have every right to <unk> I replied <unk> in 
the <unk> <unk> but my attention was fixed on <unk> the biggest 
and strongest of us. He looked as if he was going to keel over. I 
felt a <unk> in my own stomach but it wouldn't do to show these 
girls that we were <unk> Not so soon, anyway.   I <unk> 
the big man with the <unk> hair on his shoulder and said <unk> <unk> it would make an impression on the <unk> "This one is the <unk> <unk> He speaks your language too, for he is the <unk> 
of a <unk> on <unk> who made much magic and was strong and <unk> 
The <unk> <unk> has inherited this strength from his <unk> was the worst thing I could have said. Brassnose 
turned a <unk> face toward me and said <unk> <unk> you <unk> <unk> you're a <unk> They despise males who <unk> of 
their <unk> they destroy such men with their damned tests. You've <unk> me, blast you"!   At first, I thought he was out 
of his head, talking wildly like this. But a glance at <unk> and 
the other women confirmed what Brassnose had <unk> out.   The <unk> faces had hardened after my statement. At a nod from <unk> 
four <unk> and muscular girls darted to <unk> side and seized 
him by the arms. The man was an <unk> and he put up a <unk> <unk> 
but four <unk> women are more than a match for the strongest <unk> that ever <unk>   Besides, terror had <unk> some of <unk> <unk> and will. My last impression as they led him off to 
a stockade was of his pale face   In the <unk> <unk> <unk> 
means <unk> a quality which the women <unk> <unk> 
in weekly <unk> at which great quantities of a <unk> like <unk> were <unk> In the hut to which I was <unk> Max had his own <unk> 
my food was brought to me by a wrinkled <unk> with bare <unk> <unk> who seemed to enjoy <unk> with me in <unk> <unk> name was <unk> and she told me many things. For 
an <unk> <unk> old <unk> was a mine of information. 
Though I had a great dread of the island and felt I would never 
leave it alive, I eagerly wrote down everything she told me about its <unk> <unk> account was later confirmed by the <unk> <unk> 
from the University of <unk> in <unk>   From <unk> 
I heard that until about <unk> the people of this <unk> which 
was about the size of Guam or <unk> had been of both <unk> 
and that the normal family life of <unk> tribes was observed here 
with minor <unk>   But in the middle of the last century 
an island woman named <unk> seized a spear in the heat of an <unk> 
battle and <unk> the women after their men had fled. <unk> <unk> and her women had succeeded in driving a hundred <unk> 
from the <unk> of <unk> back to their war <unk> after considerable 
loss of life on both sides.   <unk> was something of a <unk> as well as a <unk> She quickly exploited the exalted 
position she now <unk> by <unk> the <unk> males and even <unk> many of them to death. Within a decade or less, few men 
were left and a <unk> society had <unk> up.   <unk> was 
great <unk> told our mothers that men were not necessary except to 
father <unk> the <unk> told me. "All men went away from here. 
Those who stayed had to pass tests. Few <unk> She <unk> with <unk> showing the <unk> of <unk> teeth. <unk> women 
then named this place <unk> <unk> for just the strongest 
men could stay here. <unk> I show you".   The old woman <unk> stiffly and led me to a clearing where a small hut <unk> In 
the shade of a palm tree in front of the <unk> dwelling I saw four 
figures in a <unk> on the <unk> guess he spent the morning getting himself all <unk> 
then headed for home. Maybe to beat up on his <unk> Benson looked 
up and saw <unk> long head <unk> forward to <unk> his chin on the <unk> edge of the overall <unk> Ramey reached out with the tire iron 
and <unk> a <unk> of mud that was <unk> on the spare tire <unk> like to know just which it is that those guys don't <unk> the liquor or <unk> Somehow the thought of a simple 
man <unk> by things no one had ever really helped him understand 
moved the <unk> For a moment his hatred toward <unk> or careless <unk> <unk> Maybe the Indian wasn't too much at <unk> <unk> thought. Maybe he was only doing the best he knew how, like any 
of us. Anyway, he doesn't deserve to lie there in the sun and be <unk> at.   <unk> see yourself spread out on the <unk> <unk> 
he said to his partner.   "You mean <unk> <unk> Just see it". Benson grinned and <unk> a rock 
with his thumb like a <unk>   <unk> just you, all the time- 
sometimes I think it's the only way I'll ever get a decent <unk>   Ramey smiled but he thought to himself, I always 
see me too. Never <unk> Whenever he saw someone lying in the <unk> <unk> wondered what the person had been thinking and he would try out <unk> in his own mind. Then he would realize they were really things 
that only he himself could think. With this <unk> <unk> 
he saw himself as he looked down.   "You seen him <unk> 
Benson said, referring to the <unk>   "He wasn't in the <unk> Ramey said.   "You didn't go clear <unk> Benson 
said. "If you want to see something, he's back on the other 
side by the <unk> of the <unk>   <unk> long a waiting <unk> <unk> answered, pretending to <unk>   A few minutes later the <unk> man, a road <unk> drove up in the gray <unk> with license <unk> on it from a <unk> state. It was a trick they used to try 
and <unk> their identity when they followed trucks to check their <unk> <unk> they just parked at the side of the road and used radar 
on the trucks as they passed. All the drivers knew about the plates 
and they also knew about the big <unk> straw hat with <unk> edges, 
the kind natives in travel ads wear when they are out <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> an agent on the east end, wore the hat, trying to 
look like a <unk> It had always seemed strange to Ramey that to <unk> himself as a <unk> an <unk> driver like <unk> would <unk> pick something <unk> and put it on his head.   The insurance 
man informed them that he had talked to <unk> who was all 
right and that he would watch the men's personal effects until they <unk> the <unk> back to town. He <unk> with Ramey and Benson for a <unk> or so in the meager shade of the <unk> Every so often the <unk> sound of a car came under the <unk> as it slowed down for 
the <unk> then <unk> up again as it got clear.   When they 
were ready to leave, Benson and Ramey walked back around the rear of 
the <unk>   "There's a body you won't mind looking <unk> 
Benson said and they stopped. She had driven up with her husband 
in a convertible with Eastern license <unk> although the two drivers 
knew nothing at the moment about that. She wore shorts and a loose <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> her dark brown hair was drawn 
straight back, <unk>   "What outfit does she drive <unk> 
Benson said.   Seeing her caused a <unk> in <unk> a <unk> 
She might have been someone he had once loved. He had never seen 
her before, but now he thought of the manner in which he and Benson 
went in and out of the cities, at each end of their run. The truck <unk> the industrial areas with walls <unk> with <unk> smoke passed <unk> through his mind- back <unk> were their access to a city 
and they could never <unk> How would you ever see her <unk> The feeling <unk> it was only a small <unk> Their work was <unk> she doing in this <unk> Benson said, and Ramey <unk> how close their thoughts might have been.   The girl 
looked around at the <unk> Her glance swung past the <unk> 
where the two drivers were <unk> It made only a tiny <unk> over 
the two 
men like a tire over a piece of gravel then moved on. She began 
to watch a <unk> man, also in <unk> standing right at the rear 
of the wrecked car in the one spot that most of the crowd had <unk> <unk> What had caught his attention was <unk> by the car <unk> so that neither the girl nor the truck drivers could see, but 
Benson knew what it was. The girl took a couple of steps toward the 
man in shorts when <unk> in that <unk> <unk> Ramey could 
never decide was <unk> said, "You don't want to go around there, <unk> The girl stopped but did not turn her head or acknowledge 
that someone had spoken to her.   The man stood near the bent <unk> body of the Indian who lay face down almost under the car. 
The two drivers moved closer.   "What does he want, a <unk> 
Benson said to <unk>   One tiny detail in a happening can <unk> the memory and stick like meat in a <unk> <unk> while the rest 
of the occurrence will go <unk> and <unk> With Ramey it was 
a dusty work shoe that was <unk> the <unk> foot that he would 
always remember. The <unk> were broken at the bottom of the <unk> 
but there was still a bow knot at the top. The slightest <unk> would 
have <unk> the shoe entirely from the foot, yet the toes were still <unk>   The two men in <unk> stood just behind the <unk> 
man. He wore tennis shorts and a white sweater with a red ~V 
at the neck, the sleeves pushed above the <unk> He turned and looked 
at them with clear blue eyes, <unk> eyes. He was very <unk> 
big hands might have torn him from a <unk> <unk>   "He's <unk> isn't <unk> the man said. He turned and bent over 
the body of the <unk> There was nothing in particular on the man's <unk> It was simply a matter of <unk> a natural right to <unk> this"? the man said, backing up a step, 
still looking down. His words were mostly to himself.   <unk> 
There was a gentle concern in <unk> voice. Ramey looked 
down and saw the white <unk> at the bottom of the man's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a bit of <unk> <unk> substance lying by 
itself on the <unk>   "But what is it"? the man said 
with a tone of <unk>   <unk> what is <unk> The man had <unk> only once. Ramey heard the words again inside, <unk> the 
way moving water sounds through a <unk> of trees, until he was not sure 
whether it was sound or <unk> pressing in his <unk> <unk> reached out once more to tap against the mass and <unk> <unk> darkened except for an <unk> clarity of the man's <unk> Ramey saw sunlight touch the <unk> blonde hairs on the brown <unk> He stared at the <unk> shining circles of hairs and heard the 
voice of his partner through trees, "Don't do that, <unk> <unk> <unk>   The man seemed to sink a little as Ramey brought 
the tire iron down on his shoulder and it seemed that the blonde 
head was turning as he hit the man again, with his <unk> Ramey swung 
and caught the man just to the left of his mouth. It was a straight, <unk> <unk> <unk> he laid all four <unk> in between 
the man's <unk> and his <unk> <unk> fist and the air expelled 
from the man's <unk> cheek made a hollow pop in the air like <unk> hands <unk> together.   The man took two short steps <unk> then sat down heavily on the <unk> Ramey heard a cry from 
the girl and felt a slight pain somewhere in his hand. As he watched 
the man sit suddenly, a detached part of his mind observed how very 
difficult it was, really, to knock a man off his feet. He hadn't 
done it this time and he would never again hit anyone so hard. 
With a thoughtful look, the man sat on the <unk> legs straight out 
in front of him. His arms hung like empty shirt <unk> and his mouth 
was slightly open. After what seemed several seconds, the open mouth <unk> dark inside then blood began to <unk> from it. The man brought 
one hand up slowly and the fingers <unk> across his face until he <unk> his mouth. He <unk> and pulled the hand away. Even yet there 
was no realization in his eyes.   Ramey could hear the crowd 
coming up rapidly behind him and the questioning voices coming over his <unk> had no identity or importance to him. He did not look <unk> <unk> someone said.   "He's <unk> 
A woman's voice said, and then he heard a sort of <unk> from 
the man's wife. The man on the ground began to <unk> one of his 
hands <unk> out on the <unk> and supported him. <unk> <unk> 
down the front of his <unk> soaking into a dark streak of dirt that 
ran <unk> across the white wool on his shoulder, as though the <unk> ~V woven into the <unk> had <unk> running a <unk> <unk> girl <unk> by her husband with one arm at his back. <unk> you <unk> can you talk to me"? she <unk> An <unk> <unk> sound came from the red mouth. The girl looked around quickly 
at several of the people. None of the crowd had stepped forward to <unk> Then she saw Ramey and her face was <unk> with <unk> did you do it- why did you hit him"? she said, 
her voice <unk> Ramey said nothing. A <unk> in her eyes suddenly 
became tears and she turned back to her husband again.   Behind <unk> feet scraped beneath sharp questioning <unk> No one seemed 
to know for sure what had happened, nor was there any purpose or responsibility 
in the <unk> feet and urgent voices behind the <unk> 
beyond finding out.   Ramey looked around and caught sight of his <unk> near the front end of the wrecked truck talking to the <unk> 
Benson moved his arms, <unk> with an unfamiliar vigor and 
talking rapidly. Ramey caught a glimpse of the insurance man. Some of 
the <unk> was gone from his face and he stared at <unk> It's 
all over now, the driver thought as he saw the patrolman turn and walk <unk> down along the <unk> toward them. Ramey watched him coming 
with a vision as clean as the <unk> on the metal sides of the <unk> 
He saw the dark sweat spots <unk> in and out of sight under the <unk> <unk> arms and in the leather <unk> that <unk> and <unk> at the side of his <unk> body, the sun left a <unk> <unk> on 
the narrow strip of blue metal that ran between the <unk> handles of 
his <unk>   "All right, step <unk> the patrolman said 
to no one in particular as he pushed between the fat man in the baseball <unk> and a young boy in <unk> He walked straight up to the man sitting 
on the ground and bent over to look at him.   "You all <unk> it's my <unk> the man said, trying 
to talk without moving his lips. His brown face looked gray from dirt <unk> where his hand had come off the dusty <unk> and rubbed across 
it. 
Then he <unk> and carefully <unk> the remaining five shots into the <unk> <unk> caught in the <unk> back of the chair, the eyes dead 
on him as the life finally went out of the <unk> The body continued 
to <unk> but now Keith used the legs of the chair to fork the <unk> <unk> mass out of the <unk> He slammed the door and listened 
as his servants ran up, <unk> at the sound of the <unk> He heard 
their <unk> and then the sounds of <unk> as they <unk> 
the snake right on the porch with wood <unk>   It was only then 
that he turned to look at <unk>   She was sitting on the edge 
of the bed again, back in the same position where the snake had found 
her. The fear had not entirely gone from her face, but there were some 
other emotions now, crowding into her eyes and the lines of her <unk> her hands were calm, now. <unk> got <unk> thought <unk> <unk> got more <unk> than any other woman in the <unk> said <unk> <unk> you were <unk> I 
don't suppose a wife should be grateful to her husband for saving

mind pretty well, by now, its quick perceptions and <unk> its painful <unk> on truth and <unk> its capacity for love almost 
too deep for a man to <unk> even in part. But her beauty always <unk> him <unk>   "I realize that this is hardly the time 
to say it, <unk> said <unk> "But knowing you, I know that 
you're glad to be alive, and <unk> and sorry because I killed 
the <unk> even though I had to. Isn't that <unk>   Penny <unk> her eyes.   "Yes", she said, almost in a <unk> 
as if admitting to a <unk>   "The snake was beautiful, wasn't <unk> asked <unk> his voice getting <unk> in spite of himself, 
as he struggled to control his growing anger. "It was a king <unk> the largest you ever saw, and it deserved to live out its life

did not answer. Now, she just sat there looking at him, without an expression 
except concern for him.   "We're all God's creatures, <unk> <unk> Keith was <unk> now. "All of us- every <unk> <unk> and <unk> and killer in that <unk> You love this village 
and these <unk> brown people because they're God's creatures, <unk> And you love <unk> that black bastard of a servant even

you're a beautiful woman. We're all God's creatures, <unk> <unk> <unk> All of us, that is, except me. You hate me, you <unk> my <unk> because I like to <unk> You actually hate me- and we 
both know it- because I killed that filthy <unk> **h Well, why don't

say <unk>   Penny would not rise to his <unk> isn't anything left to say, is there, <unk> softly let herself into the bed, and took her regular side, 
away from the door, where she slept better because Keith was between 
her and the <unk> He knew she was not <unk> not even angry at 
him. Just as he knew that she had stopped loving him.   The <unk> 
has its <unk> in the <unk> of the world, the towering 
white <unk> of the <unk> that are unknown to man as any 
other space on the <unk> For a brief period each year, the <unk> of 
the sun are warm enough to <unk> some of the <unk> piled a mile deep 
at the base of the <unk> and then the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> at high noon, and billions of <unk> of water begin their slow <unk> under the <unk> and across the <unk> hanging <unk> 
on their long, <unk> journey to the <unk> running east past the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> then turning <unk> and <unk> down through the <unk> of <unk> past the <unk> <unk> and into <unk> past <unk> and <unk> until the 
hard water of the melting <unk> <unk> with the soft drainage of fields 
and at length fans out to <unk> with the <unk> salt depths of the <unk> of <unk>   Keith Sterling had looked down on the <unk> 
more times than he could remember, during the war days when 
he flew over the <unk> of the world, thinking it high adventure in those 
times before man was guiding himself through outer space. But Keith 
looked down more than up. He thought of the <unk> below him, and 
of the <unk> <unk> <unk> beauty there and he promised himself 
that someday he would return, on foot perhaps, to hunt in this last corner 
of the world where man is sometimes himself the <unk> and animals 
the <unk>   At first it had been just a romantic dream of his, 
the same as the idea of finishing Oxford after the war. But <unk> 
the <unk> was a luxury of a phrase he did not permit himself. <unk> <unk> in the <unk> do not imply survival in the future either 
in their orders or in their attitudes, to their men or to themselves. 
And <unk> record of kills made him a man to listen to- a 
man <unk> who might even survive. He became a fighter pilot 
after the <unk> over the <unk> in the big <unk> The <unk> was Britain's <unk> of <unk> and flying a fighter plane was the way 
her sons could serve her best at this point in the war.   He knew 
how to shoot down <unk> And he knew that the men talked about him 
behind his back, saying that he was one up on everybody <unk> including 
the pilot of the plane with the <unk> on it- because he was <unk> incapable of fear. That was true, but only half the truth. 
The other half he didn't like to <unk> even to himself. He <unk> the <unk> Not defending England, or being an <unk> or fighting 
for <unk> He enjoyed <unk> And he would have enjoyed it 
just as much if he had been a <unk>   <unk> we talk as though 
the <unk> were just a short <unk> The Nazis <unk> Britain, 
so the <unk> <unk> and shot them all down. Not <unk> It 
was a war of <unk> of <unk> of <unk> endurance in which the stupid <unk> of the British on their right to their own country became <unk> an <unk> obstacle to the <unk> who were better <unk> and technically <unk> It took a long time before the 
British <unk> the balance.   Keith learned too much about air <unk> and air <unk> to be <unk> They grounded him <unk> his <unk> 
not including his true reason for wanting to <unk> and put 
him 
in the Command <unk>   That was where he met <unk> 
He was aware of her as a <unk> <unk> American <unk> 
a second lieutenant assigned to do the paper work, <unk> of how 
important <unk> might have thought she <unk> in the Command <unk> 
but that was all. Penny knew him better, on her part. He had a war <unk> but this was the kind of man women like even without <unk> 
They don't go for <unk> <unk> as a rule. He had strength 
in his <unk> <unk> but it was like the <unk> steel in a <unk> 
He was on the thin side, with big hands, and the kind of <unk> that 
give away the power in <unk> and <unk>   His hair was black, 
already <unk> at the <unk> in the classic <unk> the only 
one permitted to a man. The pretty little <unk> <unk> said 
he had the look of <unk> and <unk> <unk> the <unk> had to <unk> that in this case it <unk> Keith <was> an <unk>   Penny 
and Keith had no <unk> No dates or <unk> But they met 
in one <unk> moment that gave them to one another <unk> Command offices were in the border country, up north, where the <unk> systems centralized their intelligence reports, and the fighters 
were dispatched to <unk> the enemy. The Nazis knew this, of course, 
and while their chief <unk> was the industrial <unk> they let 
a few drop every time they went over, hoping for a lucky hit.   This 
time, they had been <unk> The Command post was <unk> and 
well <unk> But there hadn't been enough time to build it for <unk> There was a measure of protection in its concrete walls and <unk> but the engineers who hastily installed it were well aware that <unk> is not much better than <unk> if as <unk> when a 
direct hit comes along.   This one was actually more of a <unk> <unk> The bomb plunged into the ground near the <unk> but not 
precisely into the Command room itself. There was a <unk> cracking 
sound as the concrete started to <unk> the air filled with dust 
and flying <unk> and everyone in the <unk> men and women hit the 
floor and used the <unk> as <unk> as ordered.   That is, 
everyone but Keith and <unk>   They stood there, just the two 
of them, in the <unk> <unk> <unk> Keith was on his feet because 
he didn't care at all about life any <unk> Penny on her feet, <unk> because she cared too much.   The bomb was a solitary 
one. The blast <unk> but did not destroy the room. <unk> eyes 
met <unk> as they stood there in this strange marriage of destruction. 
And, as the others began to crawl out from beneath the <unk> 
and tend to those <unk> and mark the several <unk> he climbed across 
the <unk> to Penny and took her hand in his.   The <unk> 
married them, on the next day.   After the war, Penny had wanted <unk> at least to visit her home with her. She came from Ohio, 
from what she called a <unk> <unk> of two hundred <unk> as indeed 
it was to <unk> <unk> But to <unk> <unk> mind, 
such acreage sounded rather <unk> It wasn't that, however, which 
decided them not to go to America. Keith told Penny about his <unk> to return to India and <unk> He stressed the wild beauty of 
the mountains, and the <unk> He didn't tell her the truth he now <unk> admitted to himself. He couldn't stop <unk> That was his 
true love, not <unk> The terrible power of a gun, the thing that <unk> the soul out of a living body, man or <unk> was one he never 
wanted to <unk> And in the hunting land, this hunger was considered 
to be a noble thing.   When they got to <unk> in <unk> 
he was happy. This is a <unk> for <unk> This was the land of the <unk> the great water buffalo with <unk> forty inches across the <unk> The great black <unk> The <unk> <unk> the jungle stag 
that is even more noble than the Scottish <unk> He even hunted <unk> 
although the Asian <unk> is not quite as <unk> as his African <unk> But there are big <unk> in both countries. These were 
the ones Keith sought out- the <unk> the ones who killed for the <unk> of it, like himself.   He and Penny would go out on <unk> elephants, 
raised from <unk> in the <unk> And while he was ever <unk> for game, and most particularly a <unk> Penny <unk> at the <unk> they were <unk> They came upon <unk> <unk> at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> across their <unk> <unk> There were fantastic <unk> without <unk> and <unk> birds without song. <unk> <unk> played around the feet of the elephants, or fled when the mighty <unk> <unk> too close. Wild <unk> watched their progress with little <unk> eyes, and <unk> <unk> when they didn't consider such game <unk> of a shot from the <unk> <unk> the next morning, they were anchored at The <unk> and the boat 
was riding directly over the underwater <unk> where the green water turned 
to deepest blue and the <unk> dropped straight down 600 <unk> 
with the <unk> line beside it; and Robinson <unk> who had gone 
down this line ten minutes before to set a new depth record for the free <unk> was already back on the surface.   He and his safety man, <unk> <unk> swam up to the boarding ladder together. The German <unk> indicated that Robinson should mount first. Robinson <unk> heavily into the boat, sat down, and stripped off his <unk> <unk> He was frowning. He took his mask from his forehead 
and threw it, <unk> across the deck.   <unk> <unk> 
Mrs& Forsythe said, laughing <unk> A phony blonde hanging <unk> a <unk> youth and beauty, but <unk> <unk> in the neck, 
she was already working on her second gin and <unk> though it was 
not yet ten A&M&   "I <unk> it", Rob said, with a <unk> note in his voice. "All I have to do to set the record is to 
go on down. So instead I come up".   <unk> it my <unk> 
the German asked. <unk> it something went bad with the <unk> equipment was <unk> Rob stated, standing 
up. He was a huge young man of <unk> <unk> in <unk> immensely <unk> with a <unk> <unk> and <unk> of manner that 
was submerged under his present <unk> He stared <unk> at the 
floor. "I was down to <unk> I've been that far half a dozen times. 
I don't get it why this time I should pull such a stupid <unk> I get it", Artie said, still on the <unk> "You 
are a big <unk> <unk> and you got this idea about setting 
a record. And you also got this little spark in your <unk> that 
tells you to turn around before you <unk> yourself. So you turn <unk> it wasn't that", Rob said. A note of <unk> came 
into his voice. "When I came up, <unk> <I thought I was going <unk> I came up maybe fifty feet before I knew what was <unk> Artie said, and climbed <unk> right", Robinson said. "I was expecting it, sure. 
But when it happens to you like that, I tell you, and you're a 
hundred feet from where you thought you <unk> well, it makes you think. 
You don't head back down again. Not me, anyway. Not right <unk> 
He had his voice under control <unk> no one became aware that 
he was terrified by what had just happened to him.   <unk> 
the <unk> was a fellow in his middle <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and a large jaw <unk> with <unk> Now he 
was going to show how much he <unk> "Our boy didn't chicken out, 
no sir. He ran into the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> It 
makes the <unk> feel <unk>   "Well, that's the only way 
to <unk> Mrs& Forsythe said, and gave her <unk> <unk> <unk> not, if you're 200 feet under <unk> Artie <unk> Waddell went on. <unk> nothing to fool with. It 
can kill you. <unk> I don't blame him for giving up the <unk> 
much as I regret losing the <unk>   <unk> giving 
anything up", Robinson said. He stood there, towering over them <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the moving force in the <unk> and 
yet like a child among adults. "You think I got you and Artie and <unk> Schaffner all the way out here just for the boat <unk> I'm 
going down again".   "That's my <unk> Mr& Forsythe <unk> <unk> not going to give up as easy as all that". 
He was a <unk> <unk> man in his early <unk> very <unk> in his <unk> <unk> <unk> jacket and white <unk> He went to <unk> West 
every fall and winter and was the only man in town who did not know 
that his title of <unk> was never used without <unk> Old <unk> <unk> who had once lost a <unk> bet on whether 
he could get both <unk> started and turn on the running lights without <unk> turning on something else first. Now it did not occur 
to him even to wonder whether it was wise for Robinson to dive <unk> <unk> was his boy, the kid he had rescued from the streets, the object 
of his <unk>   <unk> he went on, "when Rob asked me 
if he could make his dive on this trip, I didn't think twice about 
it. I've helped him along ever since he was a youngster hanging around 
his brother's tackle shop. Hell, I gave him the first decent

years and no better off than when I started. <unk> me", he 
said <unk> He went down the steps to the <unk> and sleeping <unk> 
went into the forward <unk> and locked the door behind <unk> you <unk> go, you <unk> <unk> Mrs& Forsythe <unk> muttered something about taking a look around and <unk> up to the flying bridge. He was disturbed by what had happened 
on the dive and by what he remembered of a conversation he had had the 
night before with the German, who had come out of the head while he 
was fixing himself a drink in the <unk>   <unk> there, <unk> 
he had said. "Can I make you <unk>   "No thank 
you very much", Schaffner had answered in his <unk> English. 
"I do not drink so much, thank you".   Waddell had looked the 
man over, trying to size him up. He was in his early <unk> rather 
short and very <unk> <unk> and with a manner that was reserved 
and stiff despite his efforts to <unk> himself to American ways. His 
open face seemed to promise a sort of innocence, until one looked into 
his eyes, which had no warmth in them but only alert intelligence. <unk> had heard that he had been a <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> and he said to himself: I'd hate to run into him in the desert 
on a dark night. <unk> he had said, making <unk> tells me he's using your <unk> equipment on the <unk> Herr Schaffner had said.   "He's one <unk> of a decent boy.

Waddell turned to face him. <unk> he asked. "But that's what he told me. Why, that's 
his main reason for making the <unk>   <unk> looked at 
him, altogether without <unk> and shrugged his shoulders, making a 
little spreading gesture with his two hands.   "What do you <unk> <unk> asked, frowning.   "Please let me <unk> 
the German said <unk> his face still <unk> of <unk> "I have

moral person, but he did not like what he had just heard. "Did you 
tell him all this"? he asked.   <unk> not in so many <unk> the German said. "But surely you have misunderstood Mr& <unk> <unk> never did I offer him the exclusive rights. We spoke 
of the need for <unk> and I agreed that the deep dive would 
be most useful for <unk> He was most eager to make the <unk> 
of course, I was <unk> But there was no definite agreement about 
business <unk>   "Well, <unk> Waddell said. There 
was the end of his <unk> feature story, with <unk> He started 
out the door.   "One <unk> Herr Schaffner said. "You <unk> to speak with Mr& <unk>   "What <unk> <unk> asked.   "If you will <unk> I think it would be

said. "On the basis of the <unk>   "You will make

under the water, when he must be paying very much attention, he will 
be thinking about what you are telling him. It is not good, Mr& <unk> you will do him great <unk>   There was no doubt 
that Herr Schaffner meant every word of what he said. Waddell came 
back from the door and sat on a bunk.   "I am an honest man", 
the German said with <unk> "I will give Mr& Roy his due for 
this <unk> I will make him distributor for all of <unk> a big <unk> All tourists come to <unk> This will help him to get out 
of his little tackle shop. <unk> But there is no use causing him 
to worry at this time".   The <unk> words worked on the <unk> like a <unk> from an <unk> duty. He took a big <unk> 
of his drink. It would be a <unk> shame to throw away a story like <unk> "I think maybe you're right, <unk> he said. "He 
has the <unk> for Florida, you <unk>   "Yes", 
the German said. "At least for South <unk>   "By <unk> Waddell said, "we don't want to upset the boy at this

And make my life different and better from this time on. <unk> crossed himself again and <unk> He felt a good deal less <unk> As he reached for the door there was a knock on it and when 
he opened he found <unk> who came in and sat down on a bunk. Artie 
had picked up a <unk> and was <unk> it on his <unk> He waited <unk> before he said, <unk> you know your <unk> table, 
don't you"?   "You know I know it", Robinson answered <unk>   "You came straight up from <unk> without a <unk> <unk> said.   "Well, I was a little bit <unk> Anyway, 
I wasn't down long enough to matter. You don't see me stretched

around a bend in the trail and Matsuo took a hasty shot, then fled 
without knowing the result, ran until breath was a pain in his chest

part of the tree, <unk> a broad horizontal <unk> he could see over 
the <unk> For 
a while he was content to let events develop in their

and while his shot had probably <unk> <unk> they would soon come <unk>   His <unk> had emphasized that marines tortured 
others for the sheer pleasure. <unk> <unk> <unk> no <unk> His remembering the <unk> brought no <unk> only 
a faint chill of <unk> He murmured to himself, with <unk> "No <unk> It was best to die fighting the <unk> His <unk> 
had also preached this, saying it was the way for eternal <unk> if the marines never <unk> His comrades were all dead.

of purified water hung on his <unk> Besides the belt he wore a <unk> <unk>   As he looked up from picking at a leg <unk> he saw 
a marine in the jungle across the <unk> <unk> <unk>   The <unk> came to the edge of the green jungle mist and <unk> as though <unk> whether to brave the sunlight. His <unk> made a streak 
of almost <unk> green in the <unk>   "Come out, come 
out in the <unk> Matsuo said under his breath.   The man <unk> against a tree and wiped a sleeve across his face. A <unk> <unk> lifted his <unk> <unk> the <unk> under his left upper arm for <unk>   <unk> on his mind were events of the past day when 
his whole regiment was destroyed in the hills. They had fought from <unk> and the marines <unk> to burning them out. Even now, like 
a ringing in his ears, he heard the <unk> of <unk> <unk> 
great orange <unk> A wave of flame <unk> through their <unk> had reached <unk> his friend, and with a <unk> the man bolted 
through the <unk> then slowed to the <unk> walk of a <unk> his <unk> <unk> The marines let him advance. When he sank on his knees, 
they had allowed him to <unk> without <unk> the stroke of <unk>   Matsuo had <unk> death and was pitched on a stack of <unk> 
both the burned and the <unk> the latter <unk> rapidly 
under the tropical sun. The <unk> marines had laughed at each other's <unk> while <unk> <unk> Matsuo repeatedly <unk> down 
his own <unk> At <unk> he had been able to <unk> down a hillside 
and into the <unk> <unk> of death.   <unk> he <unk> 
to the left, to the right into the <unk> <unk> <unk> 
He decided that the marines must be <unk> around the <unk> with 
the one left to <unk> him. He strained his <unk> <unk> feet <unk> on <unk> faint <unk> of belts and <unk> <unk> 
he heard none of these. Only the hum of insects and the distant <unk> call of a <unk> Because he couldn't hear them, he was 
more convinced they were there.   A spectacle occurred across the <unk> the lone marine took a seat on the <unk> leaning <unk> 
on a tree <unk> he <unk> it. <unk> made Matsuo <unk> 
While his comrades <unk> the <unk> that one behaved as if it was some <unk> <unk> Taking aim at the man's face, Matsuo squeezed the <unk> up to the point of <unk> and then he changed his mind. 
He wanted the <unk> marine to know fear, and so he aimed above the 
head.   The shot <unk> in diminishing <unk> of sound. <unk> followed. Like a <unk> boy expecting <unk> Matsuo <unk> reaction from the <unk> How stupid to give his position 
away.   The jungle did not <unk> The sitter remained seated <unk> the tree. Before long the atmosphere <unk> to its old <unk> 
and insects <unk> and birds occasionally called. Matsuo puzzled 
and grew anxious over the complete <unk> concluding that he 
was the butt of a <unk> <unk>   Five or so minutes later the <unk> abruptly pulled up and stepped into <unk> immediately throwing 
his hands over his eyes. He went into a whirling dance, a sort of <unk> <unk> of the <unk> It ended when he <unk> but jumping right 
up, he staggered in no particular direction. He wore no head cover 
of any kind and, more <unk> had no visible weapon.   With a sudden <unk> he <unk> in <unk> direction, crossing the meadow 
in a <unk> <unk> When he got closer to the tree, Matsuo 
noted the wild look on his face. The pockets of his jacket <unk> Hand <unk>   the <unk> head was a poor target, so Matsuo shot 
him in the upper <unk>   The marine <unk> <unk> a hand high 
on his chest, and <unk> forward. In the <unk> that followed the <unk> <unk> was <unk> They could come on him now without <unk> <unk> he reached a conclusion. The marine was alone, for they 
were impatient people and by now would have <unk> to knock him from 
the tree.   <unk> the tree he scrambled and knelt at the edge of <unk> The marine was sprawled some thirty yards away, one arm <unk> <unk> jumped when the hidden arm flopped out. <unk> leveled on the man, he made a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> pressed 
in like an <unk> crowd.   He <unk> by the head, gently <unk> the rifle 
on the ground. With a <unk> motion he grasped the <unk> and, <unk> pulled the marine over on his back. He was <unk> 
The bullet had penetrated in the area of the right <unk> 
around the hole, blood <unk> in a little <unk> <unk> his <unk> on the hair, Matsuo watched the closed eyes while <unk> in

by one he tossed the objects <unk> He didn't smoke and could not light <unk> with a <unk> <unk> he had no use any longer for exact 
time, even had the watch been <unk> Then there was no saying how 
many times the marine had blown his nose on the <unk> bad the marine had no water. From its holder he took his own <unk> 
The cap was stuck and made a thin rusty <unk> as he applied <unk> The <unk> eyes opened, squeezed <unk> then opened <unk> 
in the <unk>   So, alive. Matsuo put the bottle to his 
own lips. The marine reached up a hand. Matsuo shook his head. <unk>

had he no <unk> but he lacked even the belt to hang one on. "You 
came well equipped to <unk>   Some odor made him lean over

When he rolled on the left side, <unk> on his left <unk> Matsuo <unk> his hair and pulled him back over. <unk> a good <unk> with one hand Matsuo got the cap back on the water <unk> The smell of <unk> had <unk> yesterday's events in his <unk> In the <unk> with other supplies, they had kept cases of <unk>   The marine shut his eyes.

Every

The sun was noon high and Matsuo <unk> until his body was <unk> <unk> also were the <unk> <unk> and the face had an <unk> film. The man had thrown the left hand over his eyes. Now and 
again he murmured something that ended in a <unk> He must have <unk>

for the knife. Even the bone handle <unk> and he retrieved 
the <unk> <unk> to <unk> it. First he barely touched the <unk> on the hand which <unk> the eyes. The marine yelled and flung 
the hand away. With a firm grip on the man's hair Matsuo applied the <unk> flat on a cheek. A shrill <unk> kicked legs, and <unk> hands 
that circled <unk> <unk> Matsuo <unk> free and burned the

walked toward his tree, once glancing back. The marine was still. 
He would soon die.   As Matsuo climbed by using the vines

It was the <unk> head <unk> he strained and called. Then he <unk> Matsuo by pushing and dragging himself until he <unk> He <unk> his mouth and <unk> Matsuo <unk> the rifle off his shoulder.

There is nothing for you", Matsuo said. "Your <unk>

I've nothing for you".   From the <unk> <unk> of 
the man's shoulders it was plain he had resumed the <unk> He reminded <unk> of a similar thing he had witnessed in China. In China 
it was a baby sitting on a railroad <unk> <unk> <unk> 
with the village burning about him and shells <unk> <unk> <unk> and customers hastily <unk> their tables 
as the tall young buffalo hunter pushed open the swing doors and 
walked towards the bar. Only Blue Throat and his gang stayed where 
they were. Blue Throat was slumped with his back against the bar, <unk> <unk> his massive frame. He <unk> at the stranger as the 
distance between them closed.   <unk> when did they allow <unk> <unk> into the saloon bars of this town, <unk> he asked. <unk> 
to me I don't remember <unk> any law about <unk> straightened up, alert now as the buffalo hunter came closer. <unk> 
right here where you are, <unk> he called. "I don't aim 
to have <unk> breathing down my neck when I'm <unk> stranger ignored him. He didn't stop till he was within three 
feet of Blue Throat and by that time the gang leader's right 
hand was on the butt of his <unk>   "I'm Billy <unk> 
said the stranger, "and I've come for Pat <unk> <unk> what makes you think you're going to get it, pretty <unk>   <unk> I'm <unk> Most of the time I get

"The kid has no <unk> boys. Shall we teach him <unk> His <unk> was half drawn when he asked the question, but the weapon never 
left its <unk> <unk> <unk> fist swept over in a terrific 
right cross and <unk> the big <unk> on the side of his <unk> His 
head snapped round and he <unk> back, crashing into the table where 
his <unk> were <unk>   Tilghman <unk> on to him, dragged 
him upright and hit him again, this time sending him <unk> against 
the bar. A bullet <unk> into the bar top an inch from <unk> <unk> as Blue <unk> <unk> started <unk> Tilghman <unk> himself <unk> dropped on one knee and pulled his own <unk> <unk> roared twice and two men <unk> <unk> A third shot <unk> the light. Somewhere at the far end of the room a voice yelled, 
"You all right, <unk>   "Yes, <unk> but I ain't 
got poor old <unk> body yet. And I aim to have it". He fired 
again, and somewhere in the gloom a man screamed. Another took off 
his gun belt and flung his weapons to the floor. <unk> <unk> 
I'm <unk>   "And me", said another Blue Throat <unk>   Somebody brought a light. Tilghman and his <unk> 
George <unk> <unk> the men into a corner. "And now", said Tilghman 
with deadly calm, "I'll repeat what I said. I've come 
for Pat <unk> <unk>   In two minutes the body of <unk> 
former <unk> who had been killed by Blue Throat in a gambling <unk> the previous night, was carried into the town's funeral <unk> to be prepared for decent <unk> Blue <unk> nursing an aching <unk> and a <unk> dose of wounded pride, rode out of town with the <unk> of the fight.   "That <unk> will be back <unk> <unk> George <unk> "and he'll bring fifty of his kind 
back with him. Blue Throat won't stand for this. He'll shoot up 
the town".   The prediction was correct. The Reverend James <unk> had scarcely completed Pat <unk> last <unk> on <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> when shots were heard in the <unk> said the Reverend <unk> <unk> his rifle <unk> 
up against a <unk> "and now my <unk> it would seem that 
our presence is required <unk>   Billy Tilghman and 
his comrades rode off to the battle. Blue <unk> who had ruled the 
town with his <unk> for the last six months, certainly had no intention 
of <unk> his profitable dictatorship. It was essential 
that he should restore his formidable reputation as a <unk> <unk> <unk> and this was the <unk> Wild West method 
of doing it.   He rode in at the head of sixty <unk> and <unk> <unk> and took over a <unk> barn at the entrance 
to Main Street. The entire length of the street could be <unk> with <unk> fire from this <unk> Any posse riding down the street to demand <unk> <unk> surrender would be wiped out with one deadly burst 
of fire.   The <unk> citizens of <unk> had gathered 
inside <unk> <unk> halfway down the street. Several were firing 
into the barn when Billy Tilghman <unk> He <unk> up the situation 
and shook his head.   "If Blue Throat has his way he'll 
keep us all <unk> up in here for <unk> he said. "There's only 
one thing to move him fast, and we have it right here in this very <unk>   He called the store owner and together they went into 
the <unk> Billy returned with six sticks of <unk> "I'm <unk> drop these into Blue <unk> <unk> he announced, "and 
I'd like every gun to be firing into that barn while I get near 
enough to toss 'em through the <unk>   He slipped outside, <unk> the walls of buildings and <unk> into <unk> Blue <unk> 
men spotted him and a <unk> of bullets <unk> the store <unk> 
and board walk as he passed.   <unk> yards away from the barn 
he <unk> inside a <unk> shop and came out at the back. Here he 
couldn't be seen by Blue Throat and his <unk> All he had to do 
was light the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> run to within ten yards of 
an open window in the barn and <unk> the sticks through.   Billy <unk> did just that. Within seconds the big barn was <unk> into <unk> <unk> with every <unk> either dead or injured inside. 
It was the abrupt end of Blue <unk> dictatorship in <unk> Though 
only slightly injured himself the big <unk> never returned to 
those parts.   To Tilghman the incident was just one of a long 
list of <unk> <unk> adventures on the side of the 
law which started in <unk> when he was only eighteen years old, and did 
not end till fifty years later when he was shot dead after warning 
a drunk to be quiet.   Of all the <unk> <unk> tough boys 
of the Old West, <unk> Billy <unk> stands out head and <unk> He was the <unk> who survived more <unk> than any 
other famous <unk> character in the book. He saw the most action, 
beat up more <unk> with his bare <unk> broke up the most <unk> and 
sent more <unk> to the <unk> than any other U&S& <unk> 
who lived before or after him.   For fifty years his guns and <unk> fists shot holes through and battered the <unk> out of the <unk> of law and order in the frontier towns of the West. 
The deeds of countless western <unk> and <unk> have been <unk> 
almost to the point of <unk> but because Billy Tilghman remained <unk> on the side of the law throughout his <unk> career, 
his achievements and the appalling <unk> he took while <unk> the 
West have remained almost <unk>   Citizens took the view that 
a <unk> was expected to risk his life on the odd occasion anyway, 
but this fighting fury of a man <unk> it regularly over a period of 
half a century.   He came within an ace of being <unk> with bullets 
during his long fight with the <unk> gang which <unk> Oklahoma 
in the <unk> <unk> by Bill <unk> these <unk> specialized 
in train <unk> but as a <unk> they <unk> stores and robbed <unk> making liberal use of their <unk> Bill <unk> ambition, 
it appeared, was to <unk> out his name with bullets alongside those of <unk> James and Billy the <unk> and Bill Tilghman had <unk> he would 
stop him.   Tilghman knew that some <unk> were <unk> 
with the <unk> <unk> They bought <unk> cattle from the <unk> 
kept him supplied with guns and <unk> <unk> his men in their <unk> Billy decided to set an example by <unk> one of the <unk> <unk> Ed <unk> who lived at Rock <unk>   On a bitterly 
cold day in January, <unk> accompanied only by <unk> Brown as his <unk> Tilghman left the <unk> of <unk> and headed for Rock Fort 
and <unk> <unk> It was <unk> hard when they got there and 
they saw no horses outside. The only evidence of occupation came from 
the <unk> which was <unk> out thick smoke.   The two <unk> <unk> their wagon about twenty yards from the door. "Wait here, <unk> said <unk> "If I don't come out within half an <unk> ride back to town and bring out a <unk>   <unk> his rifle 
in the wagon, Tilghman walked up to the door and <unk> on it. 
There was no reply so he shoved it open with his foot and stepped inside. <unk> opposite the door was a roaring log fire, a welcome sight 
on that bitterly cold day. <unk> near it with his back to the door 
was the <unk> Ed <unk>   <unk> <unk> said <unk> 
The rancher <unk> an <unk> but didn't move.   Tilghman 
closed the door behind him and walked towards the fire. Suddenly 
he saw something which made his big heart give a <unk> <unk> 
and caused the hairs to <unk> on the back of his neck. Along each side 
of the room were six <unk> <unk> each one <unk> off with a <unk> projecting <unk> through these curtains were the <unk> <unk> of six <unk> all trained on Billy <unk> The 
fighting <unk> had walked right into a trap and at any moment six <unk> 
might <unk> into his <unk>   <unk> fast, Tilghman never <unk> for one <unk> He walked right up to the fire as though <unk> <unk> of the guns covering him. The men behind them were <unk> <unk> and five of his <unk> every man a <unk>   <unk> <unk> said <unk> placing his hands behind him and casually <unk> his <unk> to the fire. "Just dropped in to ask where <unk> <unk> lives. Can't seem to locate <unk> in this <unk> rancher was trembling. He wouldn't look Tilghman in 
the face. <unk> the river for five <unk> he said <unk> <unk> <unk> is on the south <unk>   <unk> the overwhelming <unk> to <unk> himself out of that <unk> <unk> <unk> deliberately engaged the nervous rancher in trivial conversation 
for a good ten minutes. All that time rifle <unk> were pointing <unk> at his head and body. One false move on his part and 
he would be a dead man.   "Well", he announced, <unk> I'll 
be going now, <unk> and thanks for the <unk> He <unk> back 
to the door, <unk> softly, hands still <unk> behind him. He 
left the house and almost certain death without even increasing his pace 
and wondered by what remarkable stroke of Providence he had been 
allowed to come out alive.   But he knew well enough that those <unk> would still be trained on his back as he walked towards the wagon. 
If he showed signs of collecting his rifle and going back with his <unk> to the ranch he would be shot down instantly.   <unk> 
he climbed on to the wagon next to <unk> <unk> "Don't say or 
do <unk> he said softly. "Just get out of here without it looking 
as though we're in a <unk> That place is crawling with Bill <unk> and his <unk>   Even as he spoke those words Billy <unk> life hung on a <unk> Back in the house a <unk> named 
Red <unk> sore because Billy had been allowed to leave <unk> <unk> from a bunk and swore he was going after him to kill him right <unk>   "You'll stay right <unk> commanded Bill <unk> 
covering Red with his rifle. <unk> Tilghman is too good a man 
to shoot in the back. We'll let him go".   But the fighting <unk> <unk> run of immunity from violent death came to a 
full and final stop one night in a street at <unk> <unk> where 
he had been sent to clean up the gambling and vice <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> prohibition officer, had hit town the previous 
day and had been drinking ever since. That night he <unk> out 
of Ma <unk> dance hall and proceeded to disturb the peace by shooting 
off his <unk> 
FOR <unk> <unk> now, Jack <unk> a big <unk> boy of fifteen 
with a <unk> <unk> face and <unk> <unk> eyes with a lot 
of red in them, had been haunted by a dream, a vision, of a <unk> This <unk> had no distinct shape or size and no particular face, but she <unk> <unk> a sweet <unk> she would talk to him in a <unk> 
voice about things his mother would have said were not nice and put 
her hands on him and kiss him <unk> When she would do these <unk> he would turn blind for an instant and become sick at his stomach. 
Then he would run to the toilet behind the house. Sometimes he 
did this three or four times a day, for this <unk> was almost always 
with him. He would feel ashamed each time and wonder whether his mother 
and father <unk> thinking they might see it in his eyes or smell 
it on him. But they never said anything, so he figured it was all <unk> so when Miss Langford came to teach at the <unk> <unk> school, where Jack was a pupil in the eighth <unk> the <unk> 
of Jack's mind assumed the <unk> face and figure. He could 
not keep his eyes off her when at school; when he went home at 
night, he took her with him in his mind, and she did the things the anonymous <unk> used to do, and he did the thing <unk> each time as 
he used to do. When he awoke in the <unk> she was in his mind and 
he could hardly wait to get to school to be near her in the <unk> Langford <unk> first name was <unk> was an attractive <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> without being heavy, she cut 
a fine figure of <unk> <unk> as she <unk> among the pupils 
in her <unk> <unk> summer dress. Something was beginning to <unk> 
and come alive in her, too (it may have been there for a good while, since 
she was twenty <unk> but if it had been, it had been smothered until 
now by <unk> you could tell it by the way she watched the older, <unk> boys, like Jack. She would look at Jack, with that hidden 
something in her eyes, and Jack would see the <unk> and become <unk> 
and a little sick.   School began in August, the <unk> 
part of the year, and for the first few days Miss Langford was very <unk> with the children, letting them play a lot and the new ones sort 
of get acquainted with one another. The first two or three days they 
went home early.   <unk> that is, except Jack. He hung around 
the <unk> watching through a window from outside while Miss <unk> straightened <unk> and put the room in order. Once <unk> was 
on the third day of <unk> she <unk> down to pick up some books 
where they'd dropped on the floor and Jack looked up her <unk> 
at the bare <unk> of incredibly white leg. He thought for a moment 
his heart had stopped <unk> About that time Miss Langford straightened 
up and looked out the window directly at him, he thought, although 
probably she didn't even see him. He jumped back, <unk> and <unk> <unk> down the hill away from the school.   He didn't 
look back and he ran until he was out of sight of the <unk> and 
out of <unk> then he slowed to a walk. The vision became even stronger 
now. "I'll get her <unk> 
he muttered to himself. "I've got to get her". That night he dreamed 
a dream violent with <unk> in which he and the <unk> now the <unk> did everything except engage in the act (and this probably 
only because he had never engaged in the act in <unk> and when he <unk> the next morning his heart was <unk>   He ate <unk> that 
morning, and his mother became concerned, <unk> as he usually ate <unk>   "What's the matter, <unk> she said, with the <unk> of a middle-aged woman for her only child. <unk> 
you <unk>   "No, I'm not <unk> he said, pushing 
back the <unk> and <unk> Outside it was already hot at 7:30 <unk> 
and it was getting hot in the kitchen. He felt a little sick at 
his stomach.   "Are you <unk>   "No", he said. <unk> be all right. I guess it's this hot <unk> <unk> you play hard today then. And if you get sick, ask the teacher 
to let you come home early. <unk> left the car for me, and I'm 
going to town this <unk>   <unk> <unk> I won't 
play <unk> he <unk>   Just then Charles <unk> yelled, "Hey, <unk> from the <unk> road which ran behind the <unk> house, 
and Jack grabbed the lunch from the table and darted out the kitchen 
door, <unk> <unk> <unk> over his shoulder.   <unk> 
say, <unk> Charles said, <unk> showing his huge yellow <unk> <unk> also <unk> was tall and <unk> <unk> with 
straight black hair like an <unk> and sharp brown eyes. He considered 
himself handsome and seemed to think all the girls were after <unk> know what I done last <unk> Charles said as 
they picked their way over the rocky road which led up the hill away 
from the <unk> <unk> through a corn field and a patch of woods to 
the school.   Jack knew of course that the tale to be <unk> 
would involve a girl and probably be <unk> because girls were Charles' 
only apparent interest. But Jack always derived <unk> <unk> <unk> from Charles' <unk> <unk> when he suspected his friend 
of exaggeration or <unk> so he usually invited them, as he 
did now. "No. <unk>   "I got Margaret <unk> in one 
of them old box cars down there by the <unk>   A nude imaginary 
picture of Miss Langford flashed across Jack's mind. His heart 
beat <unk> <unk> you <unk> he said, <unk> into the <unk> 
he often used when away from his parents and especially when he 
was with <unk> <unk> you do it"?   "Hell, I <unk> 
got on top <unk>   "No, I mean <unk> you get <unk> to 
do it"?   "Hell, I <unk> ask her".   <unk> like <unk>   "Hell, yes. She's been <unk> around me 
a lot here <unk> and I <unk> I might as <unk> try it. Besides 
I heard her old uncle that <unk> there has been <unk> <unk> never heard that".   "It's all over <unk> 
If you'd get out of your back yard once in a while you might even 
get her your <unk>   "I might try it one of these <unk> 
Jack said <unk> thinking of Miss <unk> <unk> <unk> reached the school, a gang of boys and girls were already 
there playing <unk> the <unk> in front of the <unk> Miss <unk> in a fresh white dress and <unk> white <unk> without <unk> was out there with them, trying to get them inside.   <unk> 
for <unk> she yelled, <unk> a little <unk> store <unk> in her right hand. "Let's go <unk>   "Oh, come 
on Miss <unk> play with us just <unk> one of the little girls <unk> smiling <unk>   "No, not now", said the teacher. <unk> at dinner time. Come inside now".   The children <unk> stopped playing then and <unk> into the <unk> watched Miss Langford all morning. He could think of nothing 
else save his mental image of her nude figure and what Charles 
had said that morning about Margaret <unk> Occasionally he would 
look across the <unk> at <unk> fourteen and <unk> in a fresh green <unk> dress, sitting in the <unk> <unk> and he <unk> hardly believe 
she would do what Charles had said she did.   At <unk> <unk> what the teacher had said about maybe playing with the <unk> Jack stayed close to the <unk> while all the other big boys, 
except <unk> went off out the road to play ball. "Why ain't 
you <unk> <unk> he asked Charles <unk> as they sat 
in the <unk> <unk> watching the girls <unk> in front of the <unk> "Miss <unk> come out and play with us like you <unk> several of the little girls called.   "I'd <unk> 
stay here and watch the <unk> Charles grinned. "Maybe some 
of 'em will fall down and we'll see up their <unk>   <unk> 
Jack said <unk> watching for Miss <unk>   Presently 
she came out of the <unk> When she appeared, two or three 
of the little girls jumped up and down, <unk> <unk> <unk> play with <unk> Jack said, rising from where 
he sat on the ground and <unk> off his overall <unk>   <unk> 
Charles rose also, and the two of them moved over to join 
the girls.   They played crack the whip a few minutes without <unk> 
Then when Miss Langford was on the end of the line of girls, <unk> in the middle of the line, gave an extra hard pull and the young <unk> sprawled <unk> sitting down hard, her dress flying over 
her head. While she was struggling to get her skirt down and get 
on her feet again, Jack ran over, offered her his hand and said, <unk> 
I'm sorry, Miss <unk> I didn't mean to pull so <unk> all right", she said, <unk> her head back 
to get the hair out of her eyes. "It was my <unk> With one hand 
she held her skirt down while she took Jack's extended hand with 
the other. When her hand touched his, fire went through Jack and he 
felt weak, but he managed somehow to get her on her feet. He thought 
she gave him that look with the hidden something in it as he let her hand <unk>   "Thank you", she said, <unk> herself off. <unk> you play with us again, Miss <unk> one of the little 
girls said.   "No more today. Maybe some other <unk> <unk> the girl said. "I don't believe I'll 
play any more <unk>   <unk> <unk> others said, and soon 
the game broke up, the children going off in <unk> in larger groups 
and alone.   Jack walked off alone out the road in the <unk> <unk> sun, past Robert <unk> <unk> <unk> house, toward 
the field where the other boys were playing ball, thinking of what 
he would do in order to make Miss Langford have him stay in after <unk> because this was the day he had decided when he thought he saw 
the look in her eyes.   When he came back to the <unk> 
his mind was made up. He simply would not work his arithmetic problems 
when the teacher held his class. That should do it, he thought, because 
Miss Langford had said she was going to be strict about school 
work. He had considered throwing <unk> or <unk> <unk> at someone 
or pulling the hair of the girl sitting in front of him, but he 
couldn't take a chance on either of these <unk> the teacher 
probably would make him stand <unk> in a corner instead of stay 
in after school.   The only <unk> now to the plan he'd 
decided on was that someone else might fail to do his work, too, and the <unk> would have that person stay late along with Jack. "But 
I've got to take a chance on it", he told himself <unk> his surprise his plan worked <unk> "All right, if you 
can't do your arithmetic during school hours you can do it after school 
it out", Miss Langford said firmly, not <unk> "You will 
stay here thirty minutes after the others go home this afternoon and 
work your <unk>   And so when the others <unk> out that <unk> 
Jack remained <unk> in his seat near a window, looking out in 
what he hoped was a <unk> manner, while the other kids laughed and <unk> in at him and made faces as they <unk> going home. He scarcely 
saw them. His heart was <unk> like a mighty <unk> and he was 
trying to think, his mind seeming to scream at him like a hurt or frightened <unk> "How will I do <unk> the fringe of the amused <unk> of white <unk> stood a 
young woman of remarkable beauty and <unk> She <unk> little <unk> <unk> called <unk> belly and kept her green, somewhat <unk> 
eyes fixed on a <unk> male who was <unk> wildly with a <unk> <unk> snake wrapped around his bronze neck.   The youth with 
the snake had a natural pride and joy of life which appealed to the woman. <unk> and <unk> he had <unk> <unk> and his light 
color told of the European <unk> who had been intimate with the slave 
women of his family.   The <unk> white girl turned to a <unk> <unk> man standing at her side and <unk> <unk>

The <unk> handsome fellow was called Dandy <unk> by

for women of any race. But Dandy had had little experience with 
girls on his master's plantation in <unk> St& John.   <unk> <unk> he avoided feminine <unk> and seemed truly ignorant 
of the <unk> desires when they sought to make <unk> with him in

in the carriage had been new and stirring experiences to the simple <unk> Also, he was weary of plantation <unk> and <unk> Dandy <unk> <unk> entered the house with Delphine <unk> and <unk> up the rear steps to the attic room which was to 
be his new home. <unk> and <unk> though it was, the attic represented <unk> to a slave who had led a wretched life with six brothers and <unk> and <unk> relatives in a <unk> at <unk> St& <unk> bounced <unk> on the <unk> bed and was even more delighted 
when Madame <unk> after closing the <unk> showed the <unk> that the bed was designed for something other than <unk> was just as well that the ignorant Dandy enjoyed himself to the <unk> that first evening, for the room was to become his prison cell. 
When he finally left the sinister <unk> on <unk> Street, he was 
carried out in a <unk> <unk> <unk> six weeks after <unk> <unk> arrival at the <unk> the little surgeon and 
his <unk> young wife gave their annual open house and ball, to which 
only New <unk> oldest and <unk> families were <unk> <unk> orchestra played softly behind the <unk> <unk> and Delphine <unk> <unk> among her guests, <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> the latest <unk> from Paris, and Louisiana <unk> there was a <unk> upstairs, a <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and died as the musicians 
and guests <unk> at an <unk> descending the marble <unk> was Dandy <unk> clad only in a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> as if the devil were breathing hard on him. The <unk> once superb body was a mass of scars and <unk> His pinched 
face showed the <unk> of <unk>   <unk> he pointed an <unk> finger at Madame Lalaurie and <unk> <unk> <unk> 
You did this **h you like to hurt **h to beat people **h I want **h 
to go home".   These were the last words he ever <unk> <unk> 
he <unk> up some blood and collapsed into the arms of Senator <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> shirt and <unk> the politician <unk>   Dr& Louis Lalaurie examined the <unk> form of 
the slave on the <unk> dance floor and pronounced him dead. The ball 
broke up in confusion. <unk> stared with horror at Madame Lalaurie 
and made speedy <unk> Delphine stood like <unk> 
her eyes alive 
with hate as she looked down at the <unk> <unk>   But at 
the <unk> <unk> Delphine told a <unk> story.   "I 
saw the boy Dandy at the Congo Square <unk> and felt sorry 
for him. It was our hope to <unk> him and to give him his freedom 
when the right time came, for he was a bright and friendly youth who 
seemed worthy of our interest. After I paid <unk> <unk> for <unk> I brought him home, but he was ill at ease and ran away the 
same night. How he returned in such a ghastly condition, or why, I 
cannot say. Dr& Lalaurie and I didn't even know he was in the 
house until the night of our ball when he came down the <unk> <unk> at her swimming eyes with a <unk> <unk> and said 
with obvious <unk> "That poor <unk> He must have fallen in 
with evil <unk> for he was a simple youth and quite <unk> and <unk> <unk> must have robbed and beaten him before bringing 
him back to our house to die. Such a <unk> <unk>   Though 
the <unk> dying words about the woman troubled the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> an <unk> by the jury 
and <unk> The <unk> were at the top <unk> of the social <unk> 
and even a jury didn't feel privileged to doubt the <unk> 
of so <unk> a lady. Moreover, runaway slaves frequently got into 
serious trouble in New <unk> <unk>   So the <unk> was <unk> at the hands of a person or persons <unk> and the elite 
of the city, accepting <unk> <unk> welcomed her and the <unk> back into the <unk> Once again life went its <unk> way- <unk> <unk> <unk> balls and <unk>   The excitement over <unk> <unk> death <unk> and Madame <unk> stock <unk> when 
she resumed her <unk> chores of visiting the poor and bringing <unk> and comfort to <unk> patients in the county hospital. Then, 
on July 2, there occurred another incident which set <unk> to <unk> at a <unk> <unk>   Mrs& Victor <unk> socially <unk> and a neighbor of the <unk> <unk> to glance out of 
her parlor window at <unk> one evening and <unk> an amazing sight. The <unk> <unk> and his <unk> Delphine <unk> were pursuing 
a young <unk> an <unk> of <unk> <unk> across the front <unk> of the Lalaurie <unk> The girl was not more than <unk> She 
was nude to the <unk> and her tumbled abundance of black hair did not <unk> the knife <unk> on her back.   The bleeding girl was <unk> <unk> the <unk> and Delphine were gaining on her as she raced 
down <unk> Street.   The <unk> cried out in an <unk> <unk> voice: <unk> me, <unk> They have pulled out all 
my teeth and now she will <unk> out my tongue with her <unk> <unk> he would say, "all I did was put a beat to that <unk> <unk> and the first chair <unk> <unk> Since then, and 
since the pure grain had gotten him <unk> from every <unk> and 
even <unk> group from Greenwich Village to the <unk> 
he had become a <unk> <unk>   "There ain't <unk> <unk> or <unk> or more direct than a <unk> <unk> 
when you <unk> go <unk> Feathertop would say. "The accommodations 
may not be the <unk> but <unk> there ain't nobody <unk> for your <unk> <unk> <unk>   He had been <unk> 
the <unk> for a long, long time now. Ever since the <unk> and the <unk> with the <unk> and <unk> and the child. Ever since all 
that. It had been a very long time that had no form and no <unk> was- as he told himself in the <unk> of a trade no longer 
his <unk> riding the dark train out. Out and out and never to return 
again. <unk> one day the last freight had been <unk> the last pint 
had been <unk> the last beat had been <unk> That was the day it <unk> ##

THE <unk> <unk> WAS <unk> early in the <unk> was pressed far back into the corner of the car on his hay <unk> 
the <unk> and <unk> of the wheels on the rails almost covering 
the sound of his <unk>   He held his <unk> away from his <unk> and the little sweet potato <unk> neatly and <unk> as he <unk> 
its <unk>   The train slowed at a road <unk> and 
the big door slid <unk> at first <unk> caught by grains of <unk> 
then with a clash into its <unk>   The boy lifted the girl 
by the <unk> and set her on the lip of the floor. She pulled her legs 
up under her, to <unk> her full peasant skirt drawing up her <unk> and <unk> music <unk> away. <unk> that is a very nice, 
a very <unk> he murmured to himself, back in his corner.   A 
little thing, but the right twist for the action that <unk> <unk> 
that was the word, <unk> <unk> like a <unk> <unk> <unk> with the sun shining down over them. A poet, <unk> His thoughts 
for the <unk> neck, the full, high <unk> the slim <unk> and 
the long legs were less than <unk> however.   <unk> the boy <unk> himself up, twisting at the last 
moment so he landed <unk>   He was less to see, but Feathertop 
took him in, too, just to keep the records straight.   <unk> <unk> high <unk> wide <unk> mouth, a pair of <unk> <unk> hands, and a body that said well, maybe I can <unk> you for 
ten <unk> but then I'm finished.   "We made it, <unk> 
the <unk> said.   "Yeah, seems so, don't it", the boy <unk> <unk> her close.   <unk> Feathertop <unk> 
standing up, <unk> the <unk> <unk> from his dirty <unk> <unk> of that. We run a respectable house here".   They whirled 
and saw him, standing there dim in the <unk> light from the boarded <unk> wall. He was big, and <unk> and his toes stuck out of 
the <unk> tops of his shoes. He held the black plastic <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> them toward 
him. "That <unk> is <unk> over here".   The girl smiled, and 
started forward. The boy <unk> her back hard, <unk> her off her 
feet, and gathered her into the <unk> of his arm.   "Now stay 
with me, <unk> he snapped <unk> "I vowed to take care of <unk> and that's what I'm gonna do. We don't know this <unk> square <unk> Feathertop screwed his face up. This <unk> was strictly from <unk> But <unk>   "What 
is with this <unk> <unk> Feathertop inquired, <unk> against 
the <unk> <unk> wall.   <unk> we <unk> Cappy 
said. His head came up and he said it <unk>   "Well, <unk> Feathertop made an elaborate motion with his hand. 
These two were going to be easy <unk> They couldn't have much <unk> but then <unk> of the <unk> Feathertop rolled had <unk> And <unk> the <unk> had a little something the others didn't <unk> <unk> was gonna be fun <unk>   But not just <unk> Feathertop was a <unk> He liked to <unk> his meat before 
he tasted it. "Come <unk> he <unk> <unk> to the piled <unk> <unk> over the <unk> <unk> "I'm just a poor <unk> man, name <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> He grinned at them <unk> ain't your name, <unk> the boy <unk>   "And 
you <unk> you're <unk> Feathertop aimed a finger at 
him.   "Oh, <unk> on, <unk> the girl <unk> "He's <unk> He's a nice <unk> She started to move toward the hay <unk> <unk> the reluctant Cappy behind her.   Feathertop watched 
the smooth <unk> of her <unk> trim legs as she walked to the <unk> 
and tucked them beneath her, <unk> the skirt out in a wide circle. 
He cleared his <unk> it had been a long, hot while since he'd 
seen anything as nice as this within <unk> distance. 
He had it all <unk> of course. <unk> the <unk> grab his <unk> at least 
enough to get to <unk> and then have a <unk> ball 
with the <unk> <unk> <unk>   <unk> you come from, <unk> <unk> Mr& <unk> <unk> inquired <unk>   "Where <unk> he <unk> <unk> I been riding train for a ways <unk>   They <unk> into silence, and the freight <unk> up 
a hill, <unk> down the other side, shaking and <unk> to <unk> a while, <unk> murmured something to <unk> and he held 
her close, <unk> "We'll just have to wait till we pull into <unk> <unk>   "What's the matter, she <unk> go the <unk> Ernie found it immensely <unk>   The boy <unk> 
at him, and the girl looked shocked.   <unk> Certainly not, 
I mean, <unk> that isn't what I <unk> she snapped at him. 
"I only said I was <unk> We haven't had anything to eat all <unk>   <unk> <unk> Feathertop Ernie <unk> voice 
as he reached behind him, pulling out a battered carpet bag, with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> say so, fellow <unk> Why, we 
got dinner right here. <unk> <unk> help me set up the kitchen and <unk> have food in a minute or <unk>   Cappy looked <unk> 
but he moved off the <unk> and followed the dirty <unk> to 
the center of the <unk> <unk>   Ernie crouched and 
opened the carpet bag. He took out a small <unk> filled with bits of <unk> a deep pot of thin <unk> some sheets of newspaper, a book 
of matches and a wrinkled and <unk> folded piece of tin foil with <unk> in it. He put the charcoal in the <unk> lit the paper with the <unk> and carefully stretched the tin foil across the top of the <unk> charcoal <unk> man", he said, indicating the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> it", he told <unk> <unk> him 
a sheet of <unk>   "Yeah, but <unk> we gonna <unk> <unk>   <unk> Ernie <unk> a dirty finger at 
the younger man, "you try my <unk> <unk> He reached 
once more into the carpet bag and brought up a package of <unk> dogs, man. Not the <unk> but they stick to your belly <unk>   He <unk> down the <unk> <unk> and laid 
three dogs on the tin <unk> Almost immediately they began to <unk> 
He looked up and grinned.   "A <unk> <unk> he <unk> "I self <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the 
last of the <unk> taste from their fingers, they settled back, 
and Cappy offered Ernie a cigarette. <unk> <unk> Ernie thought, <unk> <unk>   "How come you're riding the <unk> kids like you"? <unk> asked.   Cappy looked down at his wide hands, and 
did not reply. But surprisingly, <unk> face came up and she said, <unk> father. He didn't want us to get married. So we ran <unk> didn't he want you to get <unk> 
This time even she did not answer. She looked down at her hands, too. 
After a few seconds, she said, <unk> didn't like <unk> It was 
my <unk>   <unk> head came around sharply. "Your <unk> <unk> It was all my <unk> If I'd been careful it never <unk> 
he stopped <unk>   <unk> eyebrows went up. "What's 
the <unk>   The girl still did not raise her <unk> but she added <unk> "I'm <unk>   Cappy raged 
at himself. "Oh he was <unk> her old <unk> You never heard <unk> 
like it: <unk> gonna go have an <unk> and <unk> <unk> go away to a <unk> and <unk> this and <unk> that **h 
like he was nuts or <unk> <unk>   Ernie nodded. 
This was a slightly different matter. He remembered <unk> and the <unk> But that had been a time before all this, a time he didn't 
think about. A time before the white lightning and the <unk> had 
turned him inside out. But these kids weren't like him.   <unk> <unk> he thought, <unk> out of it, old son. These are just another 
couple of characters to <unk> What they <unk> you <unk> Now forget 
all this <unk>   <unk> <unk> Ernie <unk> taking 
the pint of sweet <unk> from his jacket pocket.   <unk> Now 
that you <unk> The answer came from the open door of the <unk> 
From the man who had leaped in from the high bank outside, as the train 
had slowed on the grade.   Ernie stared at the man. He was <unk> Real big, with shoulders out to here, and hair all over him like 
a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> thought.   "You gonna give 
me a drink, <unk> the big man asked again, taking a step into the <unk>   Ernie hesitated a moment. This character could break 
him in half. <unk> he said, and lifted the pint to his own lips. 
He <unk> down <unk> of the strong <unk> and <unk> 
the <unk> The man stalked toward them, his big boots heavy 
on the wooden <unk> He took the bottle with undue <unk> 
and making sucking <unk> with his thick lips, <unk> it <unk> threw his head back, closed his eyes, and <unk> <unk> 
He <unk> again, and opening his eyes, threw the bottle out the 
open door.   "Well, now", he said, and reached into his pocket. 
"I didn't know I was gonna have company in this <unk> going to <unk> <unk> said, pulling her skirt 
down around her legs all the more.   "No, I don't think <unk> said the big man, and it was the final <unk> for <unk> He 
had suspected this guy was trouble, and now he was sure of <unk> you and me will, <unk> but these two ain't goin' <unk> advanced on them, and abruptly there was a shocked <unk> in the car. Ernie was screaming inside himself: <unk> <unk> you, you ain't gonna take my meal ticket away from <unk> newcomer stalked toward them, and <unk> <unk> back, her hand 
to her mouth. Her scream split up the silence of the car, accompanied 
by the <unk> of the <unk> and then Cappy came off the floor, 
his legs driving him hard. The kid hit the bigger man with an <unk> <unk> and carried him backward in a <unk> <unk> They 
went down in a heap and for a long minute there was nothing to see but <unk> arms and legs.   The kid showed for an instant, and his 
arm was <unk> back. The fist went down into the pile of flesh, and <unk> heard the bigger man's deeper voice go, <unk> they were <unk> again, and the big man reached into the 
same pocket he had gone for earlier, and came up with a vicious <unk> held the knife <unk> an <unk> an instant enough 
to press the <unk> The blade came out with a <unk> He <unk> 
the knife <unk> and drew back to <unk> it into the kid's <unk> screamed <unk> and her face was white. She grabbed 
at <unk> sleeve and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
Do <unk> neither liked nor disliked the Old <unk> To them he could 
have been the broken <unk> in the church tower which rang before and 
after <unk> and at noon, and at six each <unk> its tone, <unk> <unk> never breaking the <unk> of the streets. The Old 
Man was <unk>   Yet if he were not there, they would have <unk> him, as they would have missed the sounds of bees <unk> against 
the screen door in early <unk> or the smell of thick <unk> <unk> 
the ripe smell that was both sweet and <unk> rising up from <unk> <unk> wrapped in <unk> <unk> Or the <unk> whirling 
sounds of <unk> at night, when their black bodies <unk> into the <unk> 
above and below the <unk> street <unk> Or the bay of female 
dogs in <unk>   They never called him by name, although he had 
one. <unk> <unk> that's what he was called in the old country; 
but here he was just <unk> or the Old <unk> But this was 
not <unk> because youth in these quarters was always pushed at a distance 
from its <unk> Youth <unk> when <unk> It went to church 
on Sunday and one Saturday a month went to <unk> But youth 
asked nothing of its <unk> not a touch of the hand or a kiss given 
in passing.   The only thing unusual about the Old Man had 
long since happened. But the past was dead here as the present was dead. 
Once the Old Man had had a wife. And once she, too, ignored him. 
With a tiny <unk> wrapped around her shoulders, she <unk> her <unk> <unk> down the street before him and didn't stop. 
In one hand she clutched a hundred dollar bill and in the other a straw <unk> The way she <unk> down the street, the Old Man would 
have been blind not to have noticed both. Without looking at him, 
without looking at anything except Drexel Street directly in front of 
her, she climbed up into one of those orange <unk> rode away in 
it, and never came back.   "But she shouldn't have come here 
in the first <unk> the women had said.   "No, no. Not 
that one. She thought she was bigger than we are because she came from <unk>   <unk> <unk> She gave herself fancy <unk> 
Just because she had a part on the stage in the old country, she thought 
she could carry her head higher than <unk> They had slapped 
their <unk>   "It's not for making pretty speeches about <unk> 
those <unk> get paid so <unk>   <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> only by the <unk> of polished <unk> had <unk> <unk> beneath <unk> <unk> where tiny black hairs <unk> 
never to be <unk> away. <unk> mouths that had never known 
anything <unk> than the taste of new wine and the passion of man's <unk> had not smiled, but had condemned again and again. <unk> if the Old Man even thought about his wife 
now, nobody cared a <unk> It was enough for people to know that at 
one time he had looked down the street at the <unk> <unk> of a woman 
he had <unk> watching her become <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> as thin as the <unk> on her <unk> and still <unk> His 
voice had not commanded her to stop. It had not questioned why. The 
women said they had seen him wave an exhausted <unk> but he 
might have been <unk> away the <unk> that <unk> from his yellow dog <unk> him. <unk> was never without that <unk> And his <unk> those miniature <unk> of <unk> <unk> had not altered their expression 
or direction. The Old <unk> very soul could have left him and <unk> down that street, but he wouldn't have had anyone know <unk> he had known then where that hundred dollar bill had come 
from and where it was taking his wife. But when he called for his <unk> wrinkled sister Rose to care for him and the children, had 
he guessed that all he would remember of his woman was the memory of 
her climbing into that <unk>   There seemed to be a contemptuous 
purpose in the way he sat there with his eyes glued to Drexel 
Street and his back in opposition to the church behind him. For all 
he saw or cared to see, this could have been a town in Italy, not the <unk> of Philadelphia. It could have been Bari or <unk> for 
the way it <unk> What did it matter to him that the park at the foot 
of <unk> Road stretched beneath elevated trains that roared from the <unk> station into the city's center at half-hour <unk> Or 
that the tiny creek spun its silent course toward the <unk> 
This place was hatred to him, just as hatred was his only companion 
in his <unk> To him they were one and the same.   <unk> 
for the Old Man was framed in by a wall of <unk> trees which divided 
these quarters from the city. <unk> lined the streets with two-story 
houses the color of <unk> It slashed the sloping <unk> <unk> with concrete steps which climbed upward to white wooden <unk> 
It swayed with the <unk> <unk> and <unk> with the <unk> <unk> 
of screen doors.   Even the <unk> which housed nothing 
now but the <unk> of <unk> had a lawn before it. And the coffee shop 
on Drexel Street, where the men spent their evenings and Sundays 
playing cards, had a rose <unk> beneath its window. The <unk> <unk> 
of coffee <unk> thrown against it.   Only one house on the street 
had no lawn before it. It <unk> low and square upon the sidewalk 
with a heavy iron <unk> supporting a glass <unk> That was <unk> <unk> Above it, from a <unk> <unk> wooden <unk> surveyed 
the neighborhood. Did the Old Man remember them <unk> everywhere else <unk> was <unk> and wood in square <unk> 
like <unk> <unk> against the <unk> of the hill, rising with 
the hill to the top where the church was and beyond that to the <unk> 
Only paved <unk> <unk> through the walls of those <unk> 
into the mysterious core of <unk> behind the houses where <unk> <unk> no <unk> where one man's property <unk> with the next 
to form <unk> in which no one knew <unk> Love and hatred and <unk> were one here, <unk> only by <unk> trees and <unk> <unk> And the <unk> tongue of gossip licked its sinister way from back porch to 
back porch.   The Old Man silently fed upon these streets. They 
kept him alive, waiting. <unk> for what and for whom, only he could 
tell and would not. It was as though he had made a <unk> with the <unk> himself, but it was not yet time to pay the price. He was holding 
out for something. He was determined to hold out. <unk> Old <unk> son threw himself down, belly first, upon a concrete step, 
taking in the <unk> of it, and dreaming of the day he would be <unk> 
At fifteen he didn't care that he had no mother, that he couldn't 
remember her face or her <unk> neither did he care that Aunt Rose 
provided for him.   He was named <unk> as a tribute to his <unk> and he couldn't have cared less about that either. To him 
life was a restless <unk> that began with the rising sun and ended 
only with sleep.   When he would be a man, he would be a rich 
man. He would not be like the <unk> <unk> who lived in <unk> 
houses on the other side of the park. He would not ride the <unk> local to the city each morning. He would not carry a brief <unk> Nor would he work at all. He would square his shoulders and 
carry a cane before each step. He would sit inside the coffee shop 
and pound a <unk> fist upon the table and a girl would hear him and 
come running, <unk> with her running, calling out in her <unk> "At 
your <unk> He would order her to bring coffee, and would take 
from his <unk> pocket a thin black pipe which he would <unk> he would 
not remove his <unk> and light and smoke. He could do that when 
he would be a man.   "Hey, <unk> he called to his sister 
on the porch above the steps. She was only ten months older than <unk> <unk> what would you say if I smoked a <unk>   Laura 
did not answer him. She leaned unconcerned against the broken porch <unk> <unk> and drying her <unk> <unk> hair in the sun. One <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> and swung loosely before the <unk> <unk> <unk> Her <unk> foot, whose arch swept high and white, pointed <unk> toward <unk> <unk> toes like fingers, whose tips <unk> <unk> All the while she sat there, her <unk> arms <unk> before her <unk>   Her face showed no sign of having heard <unk> It 
was a face that had lost its <unk> <unk> and was beginning to <unk> within its fragile features a <unk> that <unk> the lyric lines 
of its <unk> The eyes, blue and always somewhat <unk> possessed 
a sullen quality. Even though the boy could not see them, he knew 
they were <unk> by distance. He was never sure they fully took 
him in.   <unk> called again, <unk> But the only answer 
that reached him was the screeching of the porch rail from her leg 
moving against it.   "She's in a <unk> he thought "There's 
not a month she doesn't get herself in a <unk>   Well, 
what did that matter when the sun was shining and there were dreams 
to dream <unk> And as for his <unk> if he wanted to smoke one, 
nobody would stop him. Not even <unk>   Suddenly he was interrupted 
in his <unk> by a warm <unk> <unk> against his <unk> 
and his eyes opened wide and long at the sight of a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> against the salt taste of him. Above the <unk> an aged <unk> eye, <unk> and <unk> <unk> within a sphere of <unk> <unk> skin, stared <unk> at him.   <unk> sake, <unk> <unk> But the <unk> would not.   "You're boiling <unk> ain't you"? <unk> it with his hand, knowing the <unk> <unk> and the swollen <unk> of <unk> that wrinkled <unk> 
to his touch. <unk> rolled over. His head <unk> <unk> covering <unk> to come straining beneath the <unk> belly within the warmth 
of those <unk> With his mouth opened wide, he <unk> the warm 
white milk against the roof of his mouth and his tongue <unk> the light, <unk> taste of it. The boy's fingers and mouth operated with 
the skilled unity of a <unk> <unk> pressing and <unk> <unk> 
in what he did.   Above him slid the <unk> shadow of a storm <unk> Its form was a heavy figure in a <unk> <unk> But the 
boy could see only the <unk> <unk>   The Old Man near the 
corner let the shadow pass over him, sensing something <unk> in 
it. He knew it was there, knew also what it was about, but he wouldn't <unk> a finger except to smooth his yellow <unk> back. There would 
be time enough, perhaps the Old Man <unk> himself, to pay the <unk> his <unk> Time enough to give up his soul.   In the <unk> 
six <unk> stained an <unk> the same color as <unk> shaved <unk> edged up close to him. The <unk> they made on the concrete <unk> him in the <unk> pleasure he knew, so that he quickly <unk> his hold on the <unk> and pretended to be examining its <unk> 
for <unk>   He knew at a glance that the biggest <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> ones to <unk> and the <unk> ones 
to <unk> <unk> <unk> brother. <unk> expected <unk> 
small body to sink closer and closer to the ground. He expected <unk> <unk> hand to reach down to grasp the boy, and her <unk> <unk> 
voice to sound against the <unk> of his <unk> flesh that 
was never sure of hearing <unk> came in and out all evening to see the baby and hold it. 
The room filled with smoke, and <unk> head <unk> with excitement 
and <unk> but Stuart had such a happy, earnest look of proud <unk> on his face that Maggie couldn't bear to do anything to <unk> it.   Little Anne rapidly <unk> her mother in <unk> 
In two months she became a fat highly social baby, with a <unk> 
of <unk> hair all over her head. She stopped flying into <unk> and 
started <unk> her <unk> she developed a <unk> and cream <unk> 
and a sunny <unk> and she asked for nothing more of life 
than that she be kept dry and comfortable and fed huge amounts of food 
at stated intervals and be carried to where she could watch activity 
going on around her.   She was so heavy that <unk> arms shook 
from lifting her and taking care of her. Maggie couldn't seem 
to 
get her strength back or catch up with herself with all she had to <unk> 
there was the big basket of clothes to be <unk> through the <unk> 
old <unk> and <unk> out and <unk> <unk> there was the daily round 
of household chores in which Maggie insisted on <unk> <unk> 
had a great deal to do with it; Stuart had been laid off at the 
produce company and had to go back to sitting in his father's office, 
taking what salary his father could hand out to him. Mr& <unk> 
would have preferred death and <unk> to having his son stay with 
his wife's people without contributing to his and his family's <unk> and besides that there were the things that had to be bought 
for the baby, <unk> and orange juice and vitamins and <unk> just plain <unk> <unk> and Stuart <unk> over figures every night, trying to find how 
they could squeeze out a few <unk> more.   In <unk> Maggie <unk> Eugenia one <unk> "Do you think you could 
find me something I could do here at home to make some money, so I could 
still watch the baby and do the rest of the <unk>   "It 
seems to me you have enough to do as it is", Eugenia said. She 
had been watching Maggie go from the washing machine to the baby to 
the stove and back again.   "I have plenty of odd moments when 
I could be doing <unk> Maggie said. "It would make me 
feel a lot better, but the <unk> Exchange isn't taking baked goods 
any more and I can't leave the baby with Grandma because she 
isn't strong enough and the baby's too young to be put in a <unk> should think <unk> Eugenia said. "For one thing 
you can stop keeping that child in <unk> dresses and changed from the <unk> out nineteen times a day".   "She's so beautiful, 
and I do like to keep her looking <unk> Maggie said. She picked 
up the baby and <unk> her fat warm little neck.   <unk> 
be just as beautiful in something that doesn't have to be <unk> <unk> said. <unk> Mae Evans said she didn't put a thing on 
her child but a <unk> <unk> until it was nine months <unk> Mae Evans got all her baby clothes from <unk> <unk> <unk> in New York, and I'm sick and tired of hearing about <unk> Mae <unk>   <unk> now, <unk> you don't 
have to snap at me", Eugenia said. "I'm just thinking of a way 
for you to be <unk>   "I'm sorry. I do seem to snap 
at everybody these days, but I would like to think of a way to make 
a little extra money".   "Well, let's see. Let's make 
a list of your <unk>   Maggie started laughing, and she laughed 
so hard she couldn't stop, and she kept on laughing while she <unk> 
the clothes out to the yard to hang them up while the sun was still <unk> When she came back Eugenia was sitting at the kitchen table 
with a pencil and envelope <unk> down words and <unk> 
"I have here that you could run a nursery of your own for working <unk> <unk> said. "We could put up <unk> on the second floor <unk> porch and turn the front bedroom into a <unk> where it's <unk> and <unk> but of course it would <unk> quite a bit of running 
up and down stairs and Chris said you were to be careful about <unk> <unk>   "You might set up a dress <unk> in the 
living <unk>   <unk> woman in the block has tried <unk> about a tea room, <unk> You could set up tables 
in the front room and serve <unk> and your baked <unk> and brown bread 
and Grandma could dress like a <unk> and tell <unk> 
"It's too <unk> And Grandma isn't strong enough to take 
on something like that, and to tell you the truth neither am <unk> sighed. She said, "Well, those are the really interesting <unk> but if you don't like any of those I can turn over some 
of my extra <unk> jobs to you, if you think you can type well <unk> I'm sure I could do that", Maggie said. "But 
it really wouldn't be <unk> taking your jobs away from <unk> worry, I can get plenty <unk> Eugenia said, wondering 
where in the world she could. Maggie was looking much happier <unk> clearing a space on the table and <unk> about how she could 
put up a typewriter right there, and be <unk> up on her <unk> 
so Eugenia wouldn't be ashamed of it. "And then whenever I have 
a minute I can be working at it, and keep an eye on the baby and the <unk> at the same time. And I can go back to my contests and be thinking 
while I'm doing the <unk>   "What are you going 
to do with your feet so you don't waste <unk>   Maggie <unk> She said, "Oh <unk> I wish **h"   <unk> wish I had three <unk> Maggie said. "All 
of them for you". <unk> grew bitterly cold toward the end of November, <unk> to the <unk> of countless numbers of people. 
The temperature dropped to twenty below at night and stood at zero during 
the days. The cold settled like a tangible <unk> over the Mile <unk> City, locking it in an icy grip that <unk> its outlines and <unk> its physical <unk> it had a look of grim <unk> <unk> <unk> other cities whose <unk> climate was cold, instead of 
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Western city <unk> in eternal <unk> at the foot of mountains stored with endless <unk> and <unk>   The <unk> huddled in the streets outside of employment <unk> outside newspaper buildings, in parks, in relief lines, 
outside government agencies. There weren't facilities to take care 
of them; there never had been a need felt for such facilities. That 
kind of poverty was regarded as the exclusive property of the East, 
which created <unk> with their stock markets and their <unk> <unk> and their <unk> <unk> of industries, protected 
by <unk> freight rates. The East was popularly supposed 
to have got the country into war and into depression, dragging the west <unk> and now the East was creating government agencies for which 
the West doubtless would have to pay.   The government offices 
were being opened but they weren't being opened fast enough and meanwhile 
the cold penetrated everything. <unk> people talked and <unk> all this government spending would have to be paid for <unk> 
but on the other hand desperate circumstances called for desperate <unk> and something had to be done.   Something had to be <unk> 
it was the theme song of millions of American people, their personal 
problems no less urgent than those of the government. Something 
had to be done. The <unk> said it to each other a dozen times 
a day.   Something had to be done about the <unk> the fuel bills, 
the washing machine, the doctor and dentist bills, about making 
money stretch for food, for the <unk> for taxes, for shoes, for half <unk> for <unk> 
for clothes, for the new <unk> in the roof, for gas 
and light <unk> about keeping warm, about keeping well, about meeting 
the minor <unk> that came up once, <unk> fifty times a day. 
Just dropping the baby's bottle and breaking it became a <unk> 
and Stuart wore out his shoes so fast that he was termed a major <unk>   The <unk> furnace consumed fuel like a giant <unk> <unk> that had to be <unk> by <unk> tons of coal into its 
evil red <unk> and no matter how much coal they put in the house remained <unk> Cold came in the <unk> cracks that seemed to have <unk> 
up, under <unk> around <unk> window frames, from the sleeping <unk> the <unk> from the <unk> cracks between <unk> on the <unk> Presently they had to give up running the furnace at full capacity 
and depend on the old coal range in the kitchen, which had never been <unk> when the new gas range was <unk> and the <unk> and 
an electric heater in <unk> room. It was so cold and so wretched 
that a sort of desperate <unk> <unk> all of them, like people <unk> or <unk> or caught in some other <unk> of circumstance 
so that time stood still and minor <unk> fell away and the only 
important thing was to <unk> together and survive.   The <unk> <unk> and they all laughed and stood in ice water to their <unk> while 
they <unk> the <unk> They lived mainly in the <unk> they 
moved <unk> bed and the baby's basket there, and the rest of 
them <unk> by the stove and ran <unk> and shivering to the upper <unk> regions and plunged into icy <unk> Grandma said it was just 
like the early mining camp days, and it was the way people ought to live, 
only she was getting too old to take the pleasure from it that she 
used to.   "You said a <unk> Eugenia said <unk> Eugenia <unk> being cold worse than anything, and she was beginning to 
find the joys of poverty wearing <unk> She said to Maggie that it was 
one thing to meet an emergency and another to <unk> in it, and it was 
beginning to look at if this one was going to last forever. <unk> of people are poor all their <unk>   <unk> of 
people haven't our brains and <unk>   "I know you when 
you start talking about brains and <unk> Maggie said. "You're 
working up to something, and if you don't watch out you'll ruin 
your whole life one of these days just to prove that the <unk> 
family is superior to everything, even a <unk>   "The 
only thing that worries me is how I'm going to prove it", Eugenia 
said.   They begged Grandma to let them put a bed in the kitchen 
for her, but Grandma said she was getting too old to sleep in strange <unk> and be seen with her teeth out, and that she hoped to die in <unk> like a Christian and if the Lord <unk> it to be of <unk> 
than it would have to be that way. She didn't want to be the only 
one with a stove in her room, especially as her life span was nearly 
run out anyway, and she insisted that Hope have the <unk> Hope wouldn't 
hear of it, and she took the heater back to <unk> room, 
and Grandma took it back to <unk> room, and the two of them dragged 
it back and forth until Grandma <unk> it over and almost set her <unk> on fire. She said that proved she wasn't to be trusted 
with a fire in her room, and she could be burned to a crisp without anybody <unk> it. Eugenia suspected her of deliberately <unk> the <unk> because she was getting tired of dragging it back and forth 
and still wanted her own way, but Hope said if Grandma wouldn't have 
the heater nobody would have it, so Grandma had to give <unk> of her to use it up. <unk> in a case like this, <unk>   "You can <unk> <unk> you read it? <unk> 
married that <unk>   "I read it, yes. This ought 
to simplify <unk> life".   <unk> had more to say. <unk> 
had gone to live in <unk> He'd mentioned it, himself, 
at church 
and everybody seemed to have the idea that <unk> had left because <unk> 
had <unk> him for <unk> <unk> "It was plain as the nose 
on your face that they're laughing about it, <unk> <unk> stayed 
to get my <unk> but it'll be a cold day in June when I go <unk> will <unk> go back, <unk> <unk> turned to go inside. <unk> me stay and take the pictures you wanted, <unk> The <unk> <unk>   <unk> She swung around. <unk> <unk>   "In <unk> <unk> You <unk> me to

he found some favorite lines from <unk> Swift on his <unk> the window in <unk> weather   I marry this man

He questioned God's taking time to telegraph the message, but 
he felt better about <unk> and he took the sealed envelope from its <unk> wondering why he had preserved it. If he died before she <unk> she would never be unable to resist opening it. In any case he 
would be thrusting a burden on his remaining <unk> making them parties 
to a <unk> peculiarly his own. It was simply <his> necessity 
to confess which had made him write and keep this thing. <unk> 
told God, <unk> he said. "Why <unk> <unk> <unk> for an old clay <unk> relic of pioneer days, he tore 
the envelope in pieces, dropping them into it, touching the little <unk> to <unk> watching it <unk> the red <unk> wax melting and <unk>

A beautiful and haunting line,

perhaps he did **h.   But there were great <unk> even for 
a small man. Beyond his window were the <unk> trees, new spring, <unk> hope, eternal life. There lay Grand <unk> <unk> 
his own young parents' <unk> but new life and promise for his <unk> <unk> He poured his <unk> of wine for the toast he'd made 
so <unk> "To absent loved <unk> But this last time he drank not

meant to, he assured her, but it was plain to her that the importance 
of these small things was lost on Mr& <unk> How strange it was 
that he could give her this handsome house and <unk> <unk> as to its 
beautiful <unk> and fail her <unk> spiritual ways.   Another <unk> far more <unk> than his manner of speaking, which 
he made only token effort to <unk> was his devotion to that old horse 
of <unk> <unk> horse, <unk> But Mr& <unk> now, <unk> my yes, indeed, <unk> He called her "the <unk> much as Mrs& <unk> spoke of "the <unk> God bless her". **h He, with <unk> or twenty horses or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> out there 
in the barn, was <unk> only of "the <unk> "the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>   For the first few months of their 
marriage she had tried to be nice about <unk> going out with him 
to watch this <unk> without price stamp <unk> around in her <unk> 
And what had <unk> <unk> invariably tried to bite her. <unk> 
Mr& <unk> said, just a <unk> anyway. <unk> back, Miss <unk> 
she's <unk> of your <unk> <unk> <unk> that, you <unk> <unk> Never concern for his wife's <unk> or the danger 
that the curled lip and big teeth might mark their own dear baby due in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> whose <unk> was due then <unk>   <unk> for hours to his <unk> that the war and <unk> <unk> poverty <unk> had robbed the mare of many a racing <unk> and to his <unk> of greatness for the <unk> 
of <unk> to come, <unk> could look forward to years of conflict with 
an <unk> who disliked her intensely and showed it. <unk> symbolized 
so much that was <unk> <unk> the indifference with which 
the <unk> and indeed the whole neighborhood now treated her 
and which she would die rather than acknowledge to her husband, his lack 
of understanding and sympathy in her present condition, her <unk> <unk> stomach.   Human birth was no <unk> to Mr& <unk> <unk> was a fine <unk> and could get here <unk> he suggested. <unk> <unk> to having Dr& <unk> a former <unk> seemed <unk> to him, but he would humor her, get anybody she wanted, the best 
never being too good for her.   The chances were against his 
being here to humor her when her time came, she was sure. He would be 
in the barn, or riding for the <unk> Night after night he 
stayed with <unk> in the dead of winter, rubbing her with <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> over her <unk> <unk> as the cook did over <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the pretty new carpet when he did come 
to the house. Yet when the dear baby came, he had <unk> over here 
in a <unk> and was as <unk> and sweet and worried and happy when 
it was all over as any husband could have been.   <unk> wished 
now that she had had Dr& <unk> feeling that somehow he wouldn't 
have allowed the dear baby to turn into <unk> There was something 
not <unk> about <unk> though their father seemed <unk> showing 
no disappointment that they hadn't been the son he wanted, saying, 
"You don't see <unk> <unk> down the <unk> <unk> day, 
Miss <unk> <unk> <unk> 'em up <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for her mother, she said firmly, <unk> for herself, <unk>   <unk> for Miss <unk> he suggested. "She 
was mighty good to you past times, an' <unk> <unk> her". Now 
she must be thinking of a <unk> something special. Just wait till 
she saw the <unk> <unk> <unk> colt in all <unk> Strong 
too, up on his legs when he was an hour old. What about Royal <unk> don't you name him Jesus <unk> 
She burst into tears.   Roy was deeply <unk> He'd had 
no idea how unhappy his sweet <unk> had been. Of course she wasn't <unk> right now, but as her strength came back her spirits didn't 
seem to rise with it. He had a good idea why not. Those elegant "At <unk> cards she sent out, now she could wear her pretty clothes 
again, and had the house all <unk> up, hadn't brought many <unk> 
in two whole months.   Doc <unk> and Miss <unk> had come. So 
had Miss <unk> <unk> full of criticisms about the changes here, 
giving thanks that her dear old father had gone to his <unk> <unk> last year, saying how much she enjoyed her boarding house in town 
in <unk> weather, was looking forward to <unk> <unk> this <unk> was an idea. Miss <unk> had been right <unk> 
ever since they were married, though you'd have thought a <unk> 
would 
have brought her <unk> Oh, she'd come to see them once, left silver <unk> <unk> for all of the trips. But when Miss <unk> went over 
right away to return the <unk> Miss <unk> couldn't have been very <unk> for she'd come back before she hardly had time to get there. 
More and more, these days, she'd been driving that pretty little <unk> that looked like her, over to <unk> and <unk> his own 
old square frame box on <unk> chickens and cats and <unk> under the 
house, everybody friendly inside, making a <unk> over the babies dressed 
like <unk> Though he was glad she got on well with his young <unk> 
she ought to be welcome at the finest house in the land, <unk> made him pretty hot under the <unk> after the idea Miss <unk> 
had given him, to be told by Miss <unk> that her holy <unk> was all reserved 
for this summer <and <unk> if you <unk> and that much as 
she regretted it, they would be unable to entertain Mrs& <unk> and 
the children. She hoped they were well.   He didn't tell Miss <unk> but she must have got word from the cook or <unk> who of course 
knew those <unk> <unk> and she really took a <unk> If he <unk> 
did such a thing again she'd die of <unk>   "Have a 
party an' leave 'em out, <unk> he suggested. "A <unk> party, 
send an invite to <unk> but them- those folks you met 
at the <unk> House, the ones I've got to know in this new <unk> 
Club affair, the whole <unk> neighborhood. We'll have <unk> 
couple <unk> <unk> <unk> in a crowd any time. I'll see 
word gets <unk>   <unk> you <unk>   Miss <unk> was <unk> that way, funny that she didn't seem to take to his ideas and <unk> up. He was downright worried about her, but there was one more 
thing he could try **h.   <unk> was surprised when <unk> <unk> 
stopped beside her on the <unk> one early summer day as she was walking 
home from the country school where she was teaching now that <unk> <unk> 
had had a call to preach in some mountain town.   Roy <unk> 
he <unk> have a nice <unk> took off his hat most <unk> 
told her to <unk> in, and he'd give her a lift to <unk> Her <unk> 
was only <unk> and she hoped he didn't notice it, as she 
settled herself, asked quickly how Miss <unk> and the babies were 
getting on.   <unk> for yourself, Miss <unk> It won't take 
a <unk> He swung in through his own wide <unk> <unk> 
the <unk> <unk> you ever did see, but Miss <unk> gets mighty <unk> <unk> <unk> the sight of a friendly face. Miss <unk> won't 
care your <unk> will <unk>   "Why of course <unk> <unk> 
said <unk> must have <unk> me", Henrietta murmured to the room. 
The <unk> of Doaty's last will and <unk> was proof enough 
of <unk> <unk> would never have left her house to a <unk> <unk> found herself <unk> an old wish, that she had told <unk> 
she was running away, that she had left something more behind her 
than the <unk> sorry note and her best <unk> <unk> Perhaps <unk> 
had guessed already and kept her <unk>   Henrietta thought, It's <unk> how much she always knew about both of us. There 
had been more to know about <unk> <unk> and most of it <unk> <unk> was the good one, or, if not always good, less frequently <unk> Their childhood would have been quite <unk> without <unk> flair for drama, especially through the long <unk> In <unk> in the city, there had been the <unk> School, which taught <unk> with a kind of <unk> passion for <unk> there had 
been lessons in French from a small Polish <unk> with a really <unk> distaste for his <unk> there had been the dancing <unk> 
Miss <unk> thin and <unk> with her <unk> <unk> and her <unk> <unk> <unk> There had been supper <unk> and <unk> <unk> and little <unk> Mama small and pretty 
and gay and Papa enormously <unk> enormously <unk> the sun 
around 
which the <unk> planets <unk>   Mama had died before 
the corruption of the family circle, the <unk> of <unk> 
It was safe to assume that Papa, <unk> heavily, had said many times 
to his remaining daughter, "Thank God your poor mother was spared <unk> and indeed it might be true that it had been easier for Henrietta 
to leave, with her hand in Charles' hand, just because 
her <unk> <unk> was gone already and would never know. Mama was <unk> 
one had always felt the need to make a safe world around <unk> I would have gone anyway, thought <unk> She had always 
been able to ignore the moral question because there had been no <unk> Only at this <unk> perhaps because it was before dawn and 
she was lying in Doaty's <unk> she found herself examining how others 
might regard her. Perhaps they would argue that morality consisted 
just of that ability to see a choice.   She turned on her side, <unk> the idea <unk> If <unk> had felt about someone as <unk> felt about <unk> would she have run away with <unk> to imagine <unk> feeling so about anyone. No <unk> 
no sin.   No <unk> no <unk>   A curious 
thought to end a curious night. The birds were really awake now in a <unk> of music, and light was beginning to creep across the room, <unk> <unk> and door, table and chair and all of Doaty's flowers 
in their artificial <unk> and <unk>   Before anything else, she 
would go to Doaty's grave with flowers from Doaty's forgotten <unk> Everything must wait upon this mission, this sentimental duty 
of a <unk> whose nature avoided <unk> She closed her eyes, remembering 
the small French <unk> enclosed by stone walls. It had 
always seemed to rain there, and even the grass was <unk>   After 
the sad impatient moment, waiting for comfort which could not come, 
she slipped out of bed and went to the open window. The garden below 
was <unk> with <unk> and enchanting in its small <unk> <unk> 
out, 
she could see a tangle of <unk> and <unk> one not quite come 
to <unk> one just beyond it. On a thrusting spray thick with <unk> 
and <unk> and swelling pink <unk> like a summer <unk> a bird <unk> and <unk> <unk> brown and alive with its own music, 
a little engine of song.   It was so pretty and <unk> that 
she felt like a child again and would have enjoyed running out <unk> 
to play on the wet grass with all the growing things, but <unk> never <unk> bare feet and she was <unk> not a child but <unk> <unk> <unk> certain <unk> <unk> suddenly neat and <unk> she dressed 
quite <unk> and went <unk>   <unk> <unk> was 
not yet up and about, reassurance that <unk> was <unk> <unk> protective 
toward this sleeping being, Henrietta found a yesterday <unk> and <unk> in a white <unk> a breakfast which was somewhat the equivalent of 
going <unk>   <unk> the garden, the <unk> <unk> yielded 
a <unk> <unk> of <unk> sweet <unk> <unk> stock and <unk> <unk> which she tied with long <unk> and took back to show <unk> who was now stirring about the kitchen and <unk> <unk> 
The <unk> came <unk> to Henrietta and begged for the flowers, <unk> the air with <unk> <unk>   Henrietta held 
her <unk> out of reach and said it was for <unk> <unk> in 
the <unk> said <unk> <unk> "Go change your shoes before you turn <unk> She sounded so exactly like <unk> that Henrietta <unk> 
her under the clear impression that she could either <unk> or stay 
home. <unk> <unk> eager for whatever lay beyond the door.   To 
a <unk> there was only one church. The <unk> <unk> just 
behind it, and the way lay through the village and close to the sea. 
For the first time in thirty years, Henrietta walked down the narrow 
street with its <unk> shops just stirring and its inhabitants <unk> 
her with the <unk> <unk> She smiled and <unk> recalling 
the <unk> feeling she had enjoyed when she was a child. <unk> some of the <unk> were <unk> but all were <unk> old man, sitting against the wall of a cottage and 
waiting for the sun to find him, gave her a more than <unk> look 
as she passed, the <unk> still plainly rising in his branches. On an <unk> 
she turned back and said good morning.   He <unk> his ear 
and shook his head at her <unk> announcing in a <unk> way that 
he had heard her the first time. He then offered his own estimate 
of the weather, which was <unk> <unk> been slow to <unk> he said. "It's my <unk> out time". He <unk> at her <unk>   "I'm taking them to the <unk> said Henrietta, 
out of a vague feeling of <unk>   <unk> be <unk> me <unk> he said <unk> "but not so <unk> they 
plan. See half of 'em in their <unk> before I choose my own <unk> 
It's <unk> myself out that does it". He regarded her with <unk> hope. <unk> like to hear how I go about it".   "It's <unk> of you", Henrietta said <unk>   <unk> <unk> He straightened himself, <unk> against the wall, and <unk> his sprawled feet together so they stood side by side in their 
old <unk> His stick ceased to be a thing to rest his chin on and became 
a <unk> for <unk> the <unk> aspects of his text. <unk> <unk> <unk> three <unk> he said <unk> "I take no water into 
my system, no water <unk> It rests the <unk>   Henrietta <unk> that she could quite see how it would, and he nodded approval 
of her <unk> good sense. <unk> the <unk> he said, "and <unk> the system. My <unk> did it, and he lived to a great <unk> 
He looked up at her sharply. "Don't remember, do <unk> did suddenly, through the link of memory with his father, 
old <unk> who must have been in his <unk> when Henrietta ran away. <unk> to the <unk> <unk> had owned the island <unk> and she 
and <unk> had often stood in front of him, <unk> by his terrible <unk> a <unk> man with a thin beard and very <unk> blue eyes like 
a <unk> more aged than possible. He had never spoken once to the <unk> <unk> but his son had been friendly, a big fellow of fifty 
or more, a <unk> captain and powerful like the sea. It must be 
that son who sat before her now, <unk> to half his size and half 
his <unk>   She said <unk> "Of course I remember <unk> so <unk> I remember you", he said. <unk> the 
young <unk> woman. <unk> away on a black night with a <unk> <unk> 
man. I know all about you".   "You do seem <unk> said <unk> <unk>   "Can't blame a man for <unk> his <unk> he said quite <unk> <unk> mine many a time, only she 
never knew it. Man in a boat, there's a lot of places he can put 
in at and a lot of reasons he can be away for a <unk> Any harm in <unk> said Henrietta <unk>   He gave 
a short hard laugh and looked at her <unk> <unk> be the one 
to <unk> he <unk> and she found herself liking his approval none 
too well, but she could not defend herself and say that her actions 
were <unk> since all actions had their own laws. <unk> this 
old man's <unk> was even less to her taste than <unk> <unk> 
open <unk> Well, she had not come back to Great Island to 
be <unk> praised or <unk> She had come to make her peace 
with the past, and of that past this ancient of the earth was only a kind 
of <unk>   She started to move away, just as a woman came out 
of the <unk> a <unk> <unk> figure with a clean <unk> 
tied over her limp print dress. She smiled vaguely at Henrietta and 
spoke to the old man. <unk> not had your breakfast yet, <unk> <unk> <unk> is no <unk> he said. <unk> and <unk> He beat the air with his <unk> and it fell from 
his <unk> and <unk> on the <unk>   "He's <unk> <unk> 
his <unk> said <unk> and bent to pick it up. "He's 
got this idea about drying out **h"   "It ain't an <unk> it ain't an <unk> she said, "how comes it 
you can drink beer but not <unk>   He looked <unk> to heaven 
and said, <unk> don't affect the tissues <unk> and the ingenious <unk> of this defense pleased Henrietta so that she <unk> 
him his <unk> of <unk>   His <unk> sighed. "Come 
on, do. The children are <unk> and Miss <unk> on her way <unk>   "To the <unk> Who <unk> <unk> me. I've got a day's work to <unk> You'll be visiting 
Miss <unk> <unk>   Henrietta nodded. How much they 
knew about <unk>   The woman <unk> must have been a tiny baby when <unk> and <unk> had stood arm in arm, watching great age grow <unk> 
answered the nod with her own. "God rest her soul, she was a sweet 
one. Come on now". She put a strong hand under the old man's 
arm and lifted him up, <unk> with the gentle cruelty and necessary <unk> that the young show toward the very old. He <unk> at her 
but let himself be led off inside the house, <unk> <unk> to make 
it clear how weak and aged he was and how he was <unk> about by 
those who still had their <unk> strength.   There was a <unk> 
of voices from <unk> young hungry sounds like cats after <unk> and 
a burst of <unk> from the old man. Henrietta looked down at her <unk> still lively with its color and <unk> and set her feet on their <unk> way again, leaving the village street and crossing the 
first field, <unk> dancing ahead of her.   At the edge of the <unk> the wild rolling land took over, <unk> with fat round bushes like <unk> They were covered with tiny white <unk> their <unk> roots <unk> at the <unk> ground, and wild birds darted in and about and 
through them so they were nearly alive with the <unk> and <unk> air was full of sounds too but <unk> ones, a <unk> humming 
as much out of the earth as out of the blue sky. She felt <unk> <unk> and almost easy until the church <unk> told her she was near 
the <unk> and she caught herself wondering what she would say to <unk>   Both church and <unk> were smaller than she remembered 
them <unk> many things had lessened while she was gone <unk> but 
the <unk> had grown so thick in thirty years that to find one named <unk> <unk> seemed suddenly impossible.   She sat 
down on the <unk> fallen with age and gray with <unk> her fingers <unk> the <unk> carved letters <unk> with green <unk> 
The day's sun was gathering its strength in gold, and she wished 
she had brought her <unk> if only to shade Doaty's flowers. A small, <unk> angel watched her from a nearby <unk> the only angel 
in the <unk>   She remembered, suddenly, a night of savage <unk> and <unk> clouds when she and <unk> having dared each <unk> had stolen out of their great safe house and come here, hand in 
hand, hoping and <unk> <unk> <unk> family had come from <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the main Japanese island of <unk> where there are still <unk> of the mysterious <unk> <unk> The <unk> were a primitive 
people, already living on the island before the principal <unk> 
of the Japanese came from Southern <unk> Apparently they were of <unk> <unk> They had white skins and blue <unk> all their men 
were <unk> and many of their women were beautiful. A <unk> few of 
them are left now, to <unk> mainly on the tourist trade and to sing 
their ancient <unk> <unk> which have the same haunting <unk> as 
the <unk> of the American Indians. Most of them have been <unk> 
but sometimes a man in <unk> or <unk> <unk> is much more <unk> than the average <unk> and occasionally a girl will be strikingly <unk> her <unk> warmed and improved by a little of the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> from the South.   Tommy <unk> was one of these fortunate <unk> She was taller than 
most Japanese girls, and had the <unk> <unk> form of the <unk> girl who is lucky enough to be <unk> Her nose was higher of <unk> her <unk> so pale as to be quite susceptible to <unk> 
and the fish and vegetable diet of her <unk> had given her teeth 
that were white and regular and strong. Her mouth, soft and full, was 
something for any man to dream about. She had black eyes, long and <unk> <unk> and the way she walked was <unk>   She had 
been in Japan just one week. It was an alien land, and she hated it <unk> she was already considering putting in <unk> requests 
for duty at San <unk> <unk> the Great <unk> <unk> 
any place the Navy had a <unk> with a threat to <unk> her commission 
if the request were not <unk> <unk> would be better than 
the land of her <unk>   There was nothing wrong with her <unk> Tommy had been assigned to the <unk> <unk> There were 
no <unk> serious <unk> the ward doctor sometimes <unk> up with 
the <unk> to serve as a marriage <unk> sometimes the Navy 
sent people back to the States to preserve a <unk> but mental 
health as a rule was very high. At present the doctor's main concern 
was in seeing to it that Japanese salvage firms were not permitted 
to operate on the <unk> of <unk> sunk too close <unk> because 
the work involved setting off <unk> <unk> at all hours. Tommy 
was interested in <unk> because there was much an understanding <unk> could do to help the patients.   But she suffered in 
her <unk> hours. Such as now, when she sat at a table in the coffee shop 
at the <unk> Club, having coffee and a <unk> to sustain 
her until <unk> She had changed into a cocktail dress, and the 
whole evening should have been before her, but already she was beginning 
to get a tight feeling at the back of her neck. This was one of the <unk> <unk> you find them all around the world. <unk> from 
the West Coast <unk> on <unk> tours of duty with the Seventh <unk> and <unk> was the Seventh <unk> principal port for <unk> <unk> and shore <unk> <unk> or later, all the gray <unk> ships came in <unk> if Tommy sat long enough, she would be sure 
to see all the young officers she had met in San <unk> and Long <unk> And she wanted desperately to see someone she had known back 
there.   She felt, rather than saw, the approach of the <unk> 
young man. He came through from the <unk> <unk> which was <unk> 
with the ice <unk> <unk> in a glass he <unk> When he saw Tommy 
sitting alone, the <unk> sound stopped. He was perhaps a trifle <unk> having been long at sea where drinking is not <unk> and consequently 
out of <unk> he wore a brown <unk> sports jacket obviously <unk> in Hong Kong, and he was of an age that marked him as 
a <unk> Probably off one of the <unk> an <unk> There 
was a <unk> <unk> perhaps, that he would be <unk> and an 
even more slender chance that his approach would be different. Japan 
did something to a man- and it wasn't just Japan, either, because 
the same thing applied anywhere <unk> It was as if foreign duty <unk> and <unk> <unk> it intimated that the folks at home would 
never know about it, and, therefore, why not?   Then the young 
man in the brown sports jacket <unk> and it was no <unk> <unk> he said, turning on what was meant to be <unk> "You <unk> <unk> Maybe you <unk> date with <unk> beg your <unk> Tommy said out of her cold <unk> 
"I don't believe I know you, and I can't understand your <unk> brand of <unk> it <was> meant to be English, wasn't <unk>   The <unk> young officer fell back on his heels, <unk> and <unk> At least, he had the decency to <unk> 
she thought.   <unk> I'm <unk> You see, I <unk> 
I mean I really had no <unk>   "Oh, <unk> you had <unk> <unk> interrupted <unk> "All wrong <unk> Then she <unk> her thumb toward the door in a very American gesture, and dropped 
into Navy <unk> "Take off, <unk>   <unk> <unk> he muttered, and took off, obviously feeling like a <unk> 
The trouble was that there was no lasting satisfaction in this for <unk> 
She felt like a <unk> too.   It hadn't been this way in <unk> or in <unk> <unk> it wasn't this way in the hospital 
at San <unk> Everybody had accepted her for what she was- a 
very charming girl. Nobody had addressed her in broken English at any 
of those places, nobody had suggested that she wasn't American. 
There are Spanish girls who look like Tommy <unk> <unk> with 
a <unk> hint of the <unk> in their <unk> there are <unk> 
from the <unk> states who are similarly <unk> and- back in the <unk> United <unk> they were regarded simply as pretty women. <unk> having been sent halfway around the world on a job she had not 
asked for, Tommy was being <unk> at every turn.   She looked <unk> <unk> Four little Japanese <unk> were <unk> 
the English language at the <unk> <unk> <unk> happened 
to be one of them. Everybody but Tommy seemed to think it was charming 
when they called, <unk> for a <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> for one cup of coffee. Two other Japanese girls 
were sitting at the <unk> both quite pretty and well <unk> One 
was with a <unk> and <unk> lieutenant <unk> the other 
was with her American husband and their exceptionally appealing children. <unk> these did nothing for <unk> <unk> She told herself <unk> and with pride, <I am an <unk>   And 
so she was, and would <unk> But she was learning that so long as she 
was in this country, and wore civilian dress in the Club, there would 
always be <unk> young men who would approach her with broken English. 
There had been occasions when some of the more experienced had 
even addressed her in what might have been perfectly good <unk> <unk> wouldn't <unk> after coming to America, her parents had spoken 
only English.   One thing was becoming increasingly sure. 
She had been sent to the wrong place for duty. There was more to service 
in the Navy <unk> Corps than the hours in the <unk> One had 
to have friends, and a congenial life in <unk> hours **h. 
Now there was <unk> male singing from the <unk> <unk> It was terribly 
off <unk> and poorly done, and Tommy could never admit to herself 
that male <unk> was a very natural and important thing, but all 
at once she felt <unk> and <unk> She finished her <unk> 
and drank her coffee and paid her <unk> she got out of the coffee <unk> before the incident could be repeated. <unk> while angry had given 
her a slight <unk> Back in her living quarters at the hospital 
she took <unk> of <unk> and <unk>   Then, after a while, 
she went to her mirror. It was all true. She certainly looked <unk> and perhaps she could not really blame the young men. And, <unk> they did not have to be so crude in their approach **h. 
There was a letter to write to her mother, and she tried to make its 
tone <unk> She promised that she would soon take a few day's leave 
and visit the uncle she had never seen, on the island of <unk> 
which was not very far from <unk> And tomorrow she would take 
time to shop for the <unk> her mother wanted to present to the young 
wife of a faculty member as a hostess gown.   <unk> of course, 
had never heard of a <unk> or Japanese <unk> which says, <unk> <unk> <unk> and is literally translated as <unk> are 
better than <unk>   Actually, this is only another way 
of saying that blood is <unk> than water. <unk> <unk> <unk> appearance at captain's <unk> was a very unusual thing, 
because the discipline <unk> there is ordinarily for the young 
and <unk> and a chief is naturally expected to stay off the report. 
But the beer hall <unk> in <unk> had been <unk> too, and <unk> Perry 
was convinced that Doc had started it through some expert tactics 
in <unk> <unk> Just why anybody should wish to start a <unk> the <unk> officer didn't know. In his opinion, Doc had not grown 
up.   The lieutenant was not entirely wrong in the <unk> There 
had never been a good reason for Doc <unk> to grow up. He had 
come into the Navy too young, with the image of the <unk> <unk> <unk> before him. The war found him much too early, and its <unk> 
and especially its awful <unk> were best forgotten in <unk> 
and elaborate practical <unk> and even now Doc had never found 
any <unk> <unk> influence. He remained young at heart, with 
an <unk> sense of humor. He <unk> about the captain's <unk> of new men, took great delight in <unk> <unk> 
with <unk> <unk> and gave no thought for tomorrow. He was doing <unk> years, and the Navy would take care of him. The job security <unk> by Doc <unk> and nearly all members of the Armed <unk> is a wonderful thing. Actually, all a man in uniform has to 
do is to get by. He may not rise to the <unk> but he can get by, and <unk> be <unk>   Doc had been under restriction to the 
ship since the <unk> left <unk> This deprived him of liberty 
in Hong Kong, but he told <unk> <unk> that Hong Kong was 
a book he had read before, and the Navy would always bring him there 
again, some day. At <unk> he was restricted to the <unk> of 
the <unk> because <unk> <unk> being <unk> knew that Doc might 
have to draw some medical supplies from the hospital or the Supply <unk> This gave Doc the whole range of the naval <unk> and <unk> him quite well. There were two things he wanted to <unk> inspect 
one of the many <unk> that had been dug into the hills on the Naval <unk> and visit an old <unk>   A telephone line had been <unk> up to <unk> the ship with the <unk> exchange. After supper, <unk> called <unk> <unk> who was now a lieutenant and had a <unk> <unk> you old <unk> <unk> <unk> 
with true <unk> "Come over and have a drink. We live down by 
the <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>   "I'll be there, but 
I'll <unk> Doc said. "I've got to run an <unk> on the 
way. See you in about an <unk>   He threw a smart <unk> at 
the <unk> went up the <unk> and turned down the wide street in front 
of the <unk> <unk> <unk> he <unk> does one enjoy one's spare <unk> He considered 
some interesting <unk> but he was on the road every day from <unk> to <unk> Then there was <unk> boating and <unk> which was 
not only good for you but also made you more <unk> the thought 
of strenuous activity left him <unk> Perhaps <unk> with a fashionable <unk> but he'd lost his clubs, hadn't played in years. 
There was swimming over at the Riverside <unk> but his skin was 
so white he looked like the bottom of a <unk> Perhaps a packing trip 
into the <unk> let his beard <unk> but that was too <unk> I could, 
he thought, take a long <unk> but <unk>   The telephone <unk>   "You missed it", <unk> voice said, "You should

church is <unk> a group of very <unk> women up in <unk> 
We call them <unk> and they go among the <unk> making friends

the <unk> glasses <unk> <unk> in the bright light, "you and I 
can't understand the many <unk> they have to <unk> 
"Why is that"?   She apparently wasn't satisfied with 
his reaction. <unk> Owen thought, <unk> and <unk> There was a slight <unk> <unk> in the region of her left eye. It gave her a <unk> winking <unk>   "Have you ever tried to reason with an <unk> 
she asked, winking wildly. "They are a very difficult group 
of people".   "I don't know much about them", Owen <unk> <unk> I suppose they have their own religion and they probably <unk> <unk> coming in and telling them what to do and what not 
to do".   She smiled in a <unk> fashion. "You know, <unk> very <unk> People don't know how much they give 
away about themselves by remarks like that. The more <unk> I do, 
the more I note how far most people are from their personal <unk> Owen kept his peace. What would happen <unk> 
That she was out for a touch was <unk> but when did she get to the <unk> Several people passed in the hall and stared as he slowly <unk> trying to close the door a little, and she slowly leaned toward 
him and raised her voice.   "How did you get by the <unk> 
he asked <unk> "I'm sure the hotel doesn't know you're <unk> around the <unk> <unk> on <unk> doors and 
talking down <unk>   "Oh, I just come once a week. <unk> day I visit a different hotel. I feel it's my duty. I do this

in pairs as much as a <unk> miles a day".   "Do 
you have any idea how far I travel every day? I have the whole Pacific <unk> Owen was aware he was getting <unk> but he 
couldn't help himself.   Mrs& <unk> Parker drew back. <unk> hardly a Christian <unk> she <unk> "You're

I don't think you'll find many active Christian <unk> 
Not that religion isn't big <unk> those <unk> and prayer books 
make a lot of money for publishing houses, but they don't get top <unk> Our key salesmen are in <unk> and <unk> I take it, plays no part in this", she said <unk> doesn't have any <unk> or <unk> he said <unk> before he caught himself. It sounded <unk> why go <unk> 
More people were <unk> he had to find some way to close this impossible <unk>   "And <unk> she said, smiling and <unk> at the <unk> <unk> "Don't forget <unk> it's 
such a big <unk>   "You know", he said, getting a grip 
on himself, "I think you're going to have to excuse me. I have 
an <unk>   "I can <unk> she said. <unk>

They must be freezing up there now. Can't you help <unk> a card or something. I'll think it over".   "I

She looked <unk> as if he had somehow disappointed the whole 
human race. She stood <unk> for a moment, then walked down 
the <unk> he heard her <unk> on another door.   It took him 
about fifteen minutes to calm <unk> then he realized he was <unk> 
He <unk> <unk> dressed and went down to the dining room for <unk> On the way he stopped at the desk to receive his mail. There 
was a check from his company, and the usual enthusiastic <unk> 
on new lines they always <unk> His lawyer had sent him a statement 
on his <unk> <unk> and there was a letter from the <unk> 
of Internal Revenue asking him to stop in his office and explain last <unk> <unk>   He ate breakfast in a sullen <unk> but <unk> when he walked out onto Virginia Street, he felt <unk> 
He looked off to the crest of the <unk> still <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> River made a wide <unk> He felt suddenly <unk> <unk> With any luck at all he could easily find a <unk> it was only three <unk> he stopped in 
at the Golden <unk> The tables were all <unk> the dice <unk> 
the bar <unk> Just to test himself, he played <unk> for quarters 
on his old <unk> five and <unk> and within an hour, he 
had <unk> surprisingly, twenty dollars. The way was opening <unk> when 
the management brought around <unk> the breakfast settled its <unk> around in his stomach.   The Golden <unk> was dimly lit 
with <unk> <unk> There were more women than men in the place, but 
he couldn't find a <unk> They all had the hard look of <unk> 
who had stopped <unk> who automatically turned the cards, hardly <unk> what showed up. The <unk> around the wall depicted early settlers 
in covered <unk> who appeared much more animated than the <unk> 
The women had a bright shining <unk> as they leaned out from 
the wall and gazed <unk> into the distance, while the men were <unk> but <unk> <unk> of course, except the <unk> party who were <unk> on <unk> to death.   "I wonder if they did eat each 
other at the <unk> Owen <unk>   He sat down next to a <unk> <unk> but she was cleaned out in twenty minutes. She <unk> a dirty word and left. Owen was surprised to see Mrs& <unk> <unk> playing the <unk> <unk> that were <unk> arranged 
by the entrance. She sat down and played two <unk> at once, looking <unk> 
as if <unk> by mechanical devices, and Owen felt sorry for the <unk> depending on her support.   A <unk> cowboy sat down 
next to him in the <unk> place. He was a little more authentic 
than usual because he smelled slightly of the <unk> "What you 
need is a steady <unk> the cowboy announced after watching Owen <unk> "You can't build on your <unk> <unk> are you <unk> Owen asked.   "I'm 
just <unk> the cowboy explained. "I keep all these plays in this 
little black book, and I watch over a <unk> period to find

I once trained a horse for <unk> <unk> but nothing like <unk> <unk> a <unk> and he photographs <unk>   Five came 
up while Owen was listening to The <unk> and he neglected to <unk> a loss of ten dollars. This proved <unk> that The <unk> 
was a <unk> so he walked on down to <unk> an even more <unk> <unk> <unk> than the Golden <unk> When he looked in the back, 
Mrs& <unk> Parker was marking <unk> <unk>   His <unk> 
spirit had <unk> he studied the pistol exhibition that <unk> <unk> as an added <unk> He <unk> a long redhead with green <unk> but she was a <unk> with her money in front of her. He had no

There was no cash <unk> everyone was <unk> silver dollars. The 
management <unk> withdrew the green stuff into the office and gave 
the customers <unk> or checks or premium points. He read a special <unk> whereby <unk> would feature a special <unk> at three <unk> <unk> <unk> (The <unk> <unk> and fourteen glamorous <unk>   He wondered if he might bag a <unk> but 
they looked frightened of him. He passed two <unk> both wearing <unk> 
and they made him feel a little <unk>   Owen found Buzz watching <unk> Buzz had on a Hawaiian shirt and was carrying some <unk> oil and dark <unk> He was shorter and <unk> than <unk> 
who felt good standing next to him. "We're all going over to Lake <unk> and try our luck at <unk> Buzz explained, still <unk> "We ran into a guy at the <unk> Room who <unk> 
we can beat the wheel. He started out as a <unk> then became a pit <unk> until the Club found him <unk> He was <unk> down checks 
at <unk>   "I'm <unk> to <unk> Owen explained. <unk> about the <unk>   "Well, <unk> Buzz 
said. "We'll see you around later".   Owen went over to 
the <unk> table and the dice were hot, but he couldn't <unk> with 
any consecutive success.   <unk> your luck, <unk> A 
short <unk> blonde in a bursting <unk> addressed him. She looked <unk> and <unk> but he didn't get the impression he was being <unk> the way he'd been <unk>   "I haven't

"and let me at those <unk> I'll make them dance the <unk> We'll

Those named in the Greek paper were manufacturing reasons to <unk> <unk> under <unk> of some call of <unk> so as to be near <unk> watching

He is the oldest and most experienced of the lot. He saw the <unk> 
not the <unk> of being identified as a <unk> Somehow he 
talked Spencer into letting him use another <unk>   There was 
a tap at the door and Oliver entered with the word that <unk> wished 
to see the <unk>   "Have him come in".   <unk> <unk> and <unk> brought the <unk> news that the <unk> <unk> and <unk> had been <unk> removed from their <unk> places.   "And also, sir, two articles which were considered <unk> now must be regarded in another light <unk> An <unk> knife and <unk> are at this moment being <unk> by McKinley

clear that <unk> was not <unk> for both Small and Cromwell 
took no step toward aiding in the sending up of the new <unk> <unk> 
till Philip Spencer had given the signal to <unk> Then, with disappointment

was sound enough and, he <unk> had been defeated only by Philip <unk> <unk> to sanction an idea he had not <unk> the <unk> was <unk> Alexander gave the order for Small

Not a man on the <unk> loyal or <unk> could be <unk> by

sound like a truly workable plan to you? Do you not think these men 
might choose the black flag here and <unk>   <unk> said, <unk> 
course they would. They are about to do so at any moment as it <unk> All that is needed is for one man to feel <unk> enough to

you, <unk>   "Yes, sir. Before God I swear I am <unk> I know nothing of any plot, if there is such a <unk> are the only man aboard who can be in <unk> 
"I cannot speak for others, sir, but I am <unk> He leaned <unk> to <unk> <unk> up at him from the deck. <unk> <unk> 
you did not find my name on any suspicious paper or <unk> <unk> I did not find your name. You were careful 
about that".   Now <unk> seeming with effort to shake 
himself from <unk> <unk> He said, <unk> is telling you the <unk> He is <unk>   Alexander shifted his gaze to <unk> 
The <unk> and <unk> of his tone suggested <unk> 
of how implicit was his own guilt in the words he had used to defend <unk> Alexander knew Spencer too well to think him nai^ve or <unk> And in a sudden wave of painful <unk> Alexander recognized 
a <unk> with <unk> Here was another human who understood 
the <unk> of <unk> with the <unk> There was good fortune 
and there was bad and Philip <unk> in <unk> and ankle <unk> 
knew it to be a truth. He expected nothing for himself but that 
which naturally follows those marked for <unk> The <unk> <unk> towering above the prisoner as a symbol of decency and authority, 
was shocked to find himself looking with sympathy upon Philip <unk> 
This tragic lad had <unk> his own <unk> But he could not 
have done so, could not have found the way, had fortune favored him. 
And because fortune had favored neither the prisoner nor the <unk> <unk> they would be each other's <unk>   <unk> 
if there is guilt, if you do not deny your own, how is it possible for <unk> to be <unk> He was your constant <unk> <unk> eyes met <unk> "I tell you he is <unk> do you think there is a reason why I should accept 
your <unk>   <unk> I have nothing to gain by defending <unk> to <unk> either, <unk>   "That's <unk> Spencer agreed and withdrew himself from the conversation. 
His eyes went back to <unk> of the sea.   "I 
am <unk> <unk> Cromwell said again. <unk> God, <unk> 
I am <unk>   And though it was logical that a man 
who could plot mass murder would not hesitate to speak an <unk> still 
it was difficult to understand why Spencer spoke only for <unk> 
The <unk> was as guilty as any. No action of his could be interpreted 
in his favor and four <unk> prior to their knowing the 
significance of the Greek paper, had seen it in <unk> hands 
while Spencer whispered <unk>   "I <unk> <unk> <unk> had told <unk> "that Spencer was teaching him <unk>   It was fantastic to turn from the seven men in <unk> 
to the <unk> where a class of <unk> <unk> him. This 
was a training ship and the training would <unk> but there was an 
element of <unk> <unk> here which Alexander recognized. Some 
of these <unk> were, in physical strength, already men and doubtless 
a percentage of them were <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> me along toward a school for young boys beginning to 
study the <unk> <unk> of <unk> lay in the <unk> The air smelled <unk> and <unk>   A young man appeared out of a side <unk> and 
walked toward us with quick <unk> He wore a long <unk> <unk> of a heavy material, dark <unk> and black boots with <unk> 
His black hat with its wide <unk> high <unk> and fur trim rode high. 
With his head <unk> he <unk> not glancing at us, and passed 
by with his clear eyes raised and fixed straight ahead. He had a <unk> <unk> a small straight nose, a short black beard, and <unk> curled <unk> I was suddenly conscious of my bare arms. The 
girls in the market place wore <unk> dresses and covered their <unk> with cloth <unk> I turned and watched him stride down the 
center of the road. His hands were swinging at his sides, and he passed 
through the <unk> market place with his back straight and, <unk> 
on his <unk> he entered an old stone building.   Rachel had seen 
me watching the young man. She smiled. "When your mother was here 
he must have been a young boy. Like the ones you will see <unk> swallowed hard and looked down at my feet <unk> along beside <unk> She led me into a twisting side <unk> The <unk> <unk> 
buildings looked boarded up, and their few windows stood high above 
our heads. Rachel said that schools and <unk> occupied most 
of the buildings. We entered one where the front door stood <unk> and <unk> a flight of steep steps to the main floor. An old man with a 
white beard and dressed in a long <unk> coat, <unk> <unk> and a 
black <unk> greeted us. Rachel talked to him. He <unk> <unk> 
and <unk> his hands over his <unk> and <unk> <unk> at me. 
I thought he would ask us to leave because Rachel and I were <unk> 
but he looked down into his beard and preceded us down the <unk> 
His toes pointed out toward the walls. He stopped in front of a 
door, placed a finger on his lips, and, still peering down into his beard, 
pushed open the door to a <unk> We stepped inside. He left <unk>   Little boys crowded together on long wooden <unk> and 
in the center of the room sat the teacher. His black beard <unk> down 
over the front of his coat. One white hand poised a stick above his <unk> He turned his <unk> <unk> eyes toward us, stared for 
a second, then shouted in <unk> <unk> two, <unk> <unk> 
the stick against the desk. The little boys <unk> out a <unk> translation 
or interpretation of the Five <unk> of <unk> which they 
had previously chanted in <unk> They chanted a fixed <unk> in time 
to the report of the <unk> Each boy opened his small mouth wide and <unk> back and forth on the bench in the way his grandfather and <unk> 
had studied and prayed in the <unk> of Europe. The 
boys were <unk> They had large bright eyes, the small <unk> <unk> 
of all babies everywhere, and hair <unk> short except for the long <unk> 
of <unk> framing their little white faces. They bent over <unk> <unk> and looked up only to watch the teacher. Since they 
did not glance curiously at us once, I guessed that there was a penalty 
for <unk> The <unk> language from the ghetto stopped. 
The teacher plunged the children into a new <unk> this time in <unk> <unk> the stick <unk>   One boy who rocked back 
and forth over his worn book had bright red hair and <unk> His tightly <unk> <unk> hung down to his narrow shoulders. In the center 
of his brilliant <unk> sat a small black <unk> His head barely 
rose above the table. I stared at him for a long time. He did not return 
my interest. My eyes traveled over the bare walls and up to the 
one partially open window high above the little figures and back to the <unk> Some of them ignored the <unk> and had apparently <unk> the 
words long ago. They <unk> the portion at the teacher, who accompanied 
them in an <unk> <unk> and <unk> them on with the <unk> 
The <unk> defined the rhythm and kept the boys <unk> I could 
not keep my eyes away from the boy with the red hair. His body pitched 
back and forth on the <unk> His front teeth were missing.   I <unk> and backed out of the room. Rachel followed, looked at me, 
and <unk> with her <unk> We walked down the cool hall <unk> 
From behind us came the <unk> of the stick and the high-pitched voices 
of the boys who would grow to devote their lives to rigid study and <unk>   I said, "How long do they keep that <unk> day", she said. <unk> for <unk> when they are <unk> 
all day".   I rubbed my hands together. They had turned <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> The old man in the <unk> clothes <unk> at the foot of the steps. He glanced down into his beard and <unk> something in <unk>   Rachel said, "He asks for <unk> passed by him. I reached into the pocket of my <unk> <unk> ten <unk> and dropped the <unk> Then I picked it up 
again and handed it to the old man. He <unk> me. I didn't look at 
him.   I grinned at Rachel. "Does this bother you"? I 
said.   She smiled to herself. <unk> of our <unk> think it's <unk> When we were <unk> a few of our orthodox people were <unk> down in the roads so we could not <unk> They said that we must 
not fight but wait for the <unk>   I was <unk> You 
had to have convictions to lie down in the road in all those clothes and 
appear as though you might wish to turn yourself out of your own home. 
You had to be stupid or crazy or <unk> And I <unk> I was <unk> You had to know, also, that you were going to <unk> All 
of it might have been <unk> but they had done it in the wrong place. 
I resented them.   Rachel faced me. Her bright eyes were <unk> 
She said, <unk> I think they are keeping religion for 
us while we play around. Your mother hated this way of life. She <unk> to change much for the children here".   I said quietly, <unk> "What did she do here? In this <unk> <unk> her tongue behind her teeth. <unk> nothing. But when 
she saw the children you have just <unk> she wanted to take them away 
and put them out in the country, in the <unk> She loved the children. 
She was a strange woman, your mother. When she <unk> it was 
with a passion that drove her along and carried along with her those 
things she loved. Nothing was too impossible for her to do when she <unk> She stayed here to work for <unk> For many <unk> for 
many children, the first thing they knew of Israel and freedom was your <unk> Sometimes it was dangerous for her". Rachel grinned <unk> 
"But she loved danger. She took it with her wherever she <unk> 
she chose it. And I think she sought out danger as much as she sought 
out helping other people. She was most strange woman. <unk> to <unk> her <unk> It was an impulse when she was here in <unk> <unk> 
I was with her- that led her to stay in <unk> Your 
mother wanted to bring children to Israel so that they could leave 
their <unk> Here they did not need to be in <unk> If she could 
not take the children out of this section, at least she could take other 
children out of their countries and put them on the <unk> She set 
out to make sure that no Jewish child <unk> in the world had to 
live in a place such as this".   I said quietly, gaining <unk> 
ready to ask any question at all, no matter how <unk> ready to 
be <unk> "Then why did she leave <unk> I'd like to know 
that very much".   Rachel <unk> her hands together and slowed 
her pace. The <unk> of her <unk> reported sharply on the <unk> 
She <unk> her lips, then clamped them together so tightly that 
I thought she was angry with me. But she sighed and her face <unk> <unk> came into her life. She had good friends here, people 
who liked her. Who loved her. But she had to go out and hurt herself. 
There was a man here in town. He helped her meet people so she could 
go out and do the work she <unk> She worked very hard. There was 
a <unk> who was able to come here because of her. He came with his <unk> At first I thought they were relatives of your mother, but it 
was not so. This <unk> was a middle-aged man, a big, handsome man 
with a <unk> to his walk as I have never before seen. He had the black <unk> on his arm, so he had been <unk> in a concentration camp. 
Yet he walked like a young man. Often he was terribly <unk> 
and talked to no one. Then he would walk off for a few days alone in 
the direction of Europe. All his family was dead, except for his son. 
Your mother would always <unk> him when he wandered off, and she 
would send him home to his son. He loved the son and was always glad 
to be sent back to him. Then his son did <unk> Rachel threw 
up her <unk> "I don't know what, but something, to an official <unk> it was during the <unk> and the son was <unk> A 
few hours after the son was <unk> your mother was <unk> She 
ran from a little group of us. We were sitting together, talking. She 
went to the father and found he had hanged <unk> Rachel <unk> 
It was silent in the stone <unk> Then she continued with energy, 
"I myself did not see her until a week after she had run off to find 
the father. No one saw her except the man <unk>   "Yes", 
I said. 
"I know him".   Rachel gave me a <unk> <unk> <unk> She said, <unk> wanted your mother to give up her deep 
interest in this <unk> He said she would only hurt herself. He complained 
to me once that I must talk to her. When I did, she shrugged 
her shoulders and said that <unk> wanted her to marry him. I asked 
her if she would, and she said she would not. He had known when 
he first helped her to meet the right people and work with them that she 
did not intend to marry him. Anyway, I did not see her until two 
weeks after the <unk> hanged himself. She came to me one day. She 
was pale and <unk> she was terribly alone. And she said that after 
this man had been dead for a week she had gone to <unk> and accepted 
his <unk> He shouted at her and told her he loved her and couldn't 
understand why she had upset herself. But now he was happy she 
would let him <unk> out her life and take care of her. He would 
never let her harm herself again. For one whole week he never let her 
stay alone. She let him lead her around. He took her to a doctor, 
for she was run down, <unk> did not care where she was. <unk> took 
her with him wherever he went. He did not let her talk to people; 
he did not let her choose her own food. She was limp and beaten from 
her <unk> she did not care. <unk> I'll take you with me". The two of them against the world. 
That had been how she imagined it. For when he began to talk and <unk> all at the same time, making his plans as he went, she had begun <unk> too. But now the dream was over. The big waking up had <unk> did I <unk> she thought. "Did I see 
him about to swing low in a <unk> Or maybe <unk> up the south <unk> of the <unk> <unk> River <unk> the <unk> dumped in it? Maybe 
I saw him on a barge with a gang of <unk> <unk> <unk> I'll take you with <unk> He had taken her all right. <unk> nights after youth fellowship. Out of the church and into 
his big car, it <unk> over the road with him driving and the headlights <unk> the <unk> ahead and after he hit college, his <unk> 
the quaint little pine board tourist courts, <unk> really, with a <unk> naked light <unk> in the ceiling <unk> and naked as a <unk> 
like the one on the corner where you used to play when you were 
a <unk> where you watched the <unk> <unk> in after the <unk> watching 
in between your <unk> at <unk> a room complete with <unk> <unk> 
the light and the few casual <unk> cruising the walls, an insect <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> And the bed that <unk> in 
a certain place where all the weight had been put too many times before 
and the walls fine and thin for <unk> talk in the next room when <unk> went out for <unk> the sound coming through the walls like something 
on the other side of the <unk> so you knew they heard <you> 
when <unk> were quiet and while you lay wondering what they had 
heard you <unk>   And Gratt <unk> would be in <unk> today 
for the wedding <unk> and then tomorrow he would marry just like 
everybody knew he would, just like everybody knew all along. Like <unk> and the mayor up there gripping the <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
back in his office <unk> out teeth, like they all knew he would. 
Just like the balloon would go up and you could sit all day and <unk> it would spring a <unk> or blow to hell up and burn and nothing like 
that would happen. Or you could hope the <unk> wouldn't open 
just so you could say you saw it not open, not because you meant any <unk> to <unk> <unk> in his suit of red <unk> but mainly because 
you were tired of being an old <unk> a thing which cannot admit when 
it thinks it might be <unk> but must stand the <unk> feeling all 
alone and go on like everything is all right instead of being able to 
say to somebody in a normal voice: "I think I'm <unk> 
You could wish that. Or you could wish your <unk> would really do it- <unk> Gratt <unk> like he said when you all the time, all along, 
could feel the nerve <unk> out of him like air out of a <unk> <unk> when you are on a muddy road alone and it is <unk> and at night. 
So you sit in the car and listen to the air run out and listen to 
the rain and see the mud in front of the <unk> waiting for you, 
for your new spectator <unk> waiting for you to <unk> by yourself out 
there in your tight <unk> crying and afraid and trying to get that damned <unk> tire off, because that is being an old maid too, 
if you happen to drive a car, it is changing the tire yourself in the 
night, and in the mud and the rain, <unk> to get out in it but afraid 
to stay and afraid to try to walk out for help. And every sound that 
might be the rain also might be the man who thinks after he has <unk> 
you he has to beat your brains out with a tire tool so you won't <unk> 
a combination like ham and eggs, <unk> her and kill <unk> and that 
is being an old maid too. It is not having his baby <unk> warm 
and fat against your breast and it is not having somebody that really 
gives a damn whether some <unk> cracks your <unk> And most of all it 
is not having the only man you could love, whether he drives a bread <unk> or <unk> the mail or checks the <unk> <unk> down at the <unk> 
or owns seventeen oil <unk> and six diamond <unk> for if you <unk> <unk> what he <is> or <unk> makes no difference if he is the <unk> He can even be a <unk> <unk> guy with <unk> 
ideas and level gray eyes and a heart even <unk> couldn't figure 
out, how it is <unk> And he can be on the way to <unk> your <unk> <unk> can, and you discover you can stay alive and hate him and 
love him and want him even if it means you want him- <unk> want <unk> dead. Because if you can't then nobody else can either, 
nobody else can have him. For you don't share him, not even with God. 
If it is love, you <unk>   <And I'll take you with <unk> 
Even if that's all the promise he ever gave or ever will <unk> 
the giving of it once was enough and you believed it then and you will 
always believe it, even when it is finally the only thing in the world 
you have left to believe, and the whole world is telling you that <one> 
was a <unk> Even when he is on the way to <unk> you will still 
have the promise resting inside you like a <unk> and it is he inside 
of you. And in a way the promise works out true, for whether he wants 
you or not, you go with him in your heart. You feel him every mile 
further away. You feel where he is and what he <unk> and at night you 
feel when he is asleep or with the other woman, the one that never could 
love him the way you do, the one who got him because she didn't 
particularly give a damn whether she got him or didn't. And you know 
you will always wonder all of your life whether it was because you wanted 
him so bad that you didn't get him, and you can feel nearly sorry 
enough to cry when you think of that other guy, the <unk> who begged 
you to marry him, the one with the <unk> hair and the car he couldn't <unk> and the <unk> shoes. You <unk> "Did he feel 
that way about me"? It comes to you that probably he did feel that 
way 
to let you use him like you did when you couldn't have Gratt <unk> 
that he must have since he was there like the radio for you to 
turn on or snap off when you got tired of him, that other <unk> It <unk> 
on you that instead of a lump to fill the seat across the bridge table 
from you, he was a man, and that because Gratt <unk> was making 
you <unk> you were passing it down to him, to Gratt <unk> <unk> that other <unk> And you wonder if that is why the little 
man lost his job and his car and stayed drunk about a year before he <unk> out and moved to St& Louis, where he got to be a big 
unhappy success. You wonder if he looks at his wife now and thinks of 
you. You wonder about the Christmas card with no name on it, and it 
comes to you that maybe it would have been better to have made somebody 
else happy if you couldn't be happy yourself, to give somebody else 
the one they <unk> to give them you.   <unk> the world", 
she thought. She looked out at the corn field, the great green deep <unk> of it rolled out like the sea in the field beyond the <unk> <unk> bordering the grounds. The mayor <unk> factories there. <unk> and factories and schools and a big wide federal <unk> instead 
of peaceful corn to rest your eyes on while you tried to rest your <unk> while you tried not to look at the balloon and the <unk> 
and the uniforms and the flash of the <unk> The bands were <unk> 
but they were the only ones. The others, the ones in the stands, 
were <unk> for hearing the mayor was for them like listening 
to a symphony was for sophisticated folks in New York City. It was 
like being in the concert hall in the afternoon and hearing the piano <unk> <unk> He was good and they knew that what he was doing 
for them he would do all over the United States some day. So they 
stayed quiet and hung not on what he said but on how he said it, not <unk> <unk> but rather, <unk> If a man was good, if he 
was going to be <unk> you felt it and you wanted him to go on forever. 
You were sorry when he finished talking because while he was up 
there you were someone else and the world was something else too. It 
was a place full of courage and hope and you were part of it. You <unk> and then your chest <unk> and you felt you could cry for a little <unk> and then a feeling hit you like a chill in your stomach and 
the <unk> <unk> <unk> along your arm. He hit the theme about dying 
to defend your country, and you were ready to do it right then, without 
a second thought. While he talked you wouldn't trade being a West <unk> farmer for being anything else in the whole damned world, 
no matter if it <unk> in six weeks, <unk> enough to wet a <unk> <unk>   She glanced at the man nodding beside her, a man with 
weather cracks <unk> into his lean cheeks, with <unk> pale eyes reflecting 
all the <unk> he had seen, reflecting the sky and the <unk> 
which must follow now in <unk> yes, with eyes predicting the <unk> and here it was only June, only festival time again and thoughts 
of Gratt <unk> would not leave her. "I should have stayed at 
the <unk> she thought.   Back at the <unk> with 
the other old <unk> back there she was the youngest clerk and she was <unk> which made her young enough to resent the usual ideal working <unk> like the <unk> toilet with the door you had 
to hold shut while you sat down. There was no lock because Herman didn't 
allow a <unk> A lock on the toilet would encourage <unk> 
and <unk> The toilet hadn't had a sincere <unk> in years and 
there were things written on the walls of the little <unk> place 
because you couldn't keep the public out- <unk> She could not <unk> the times Herman had <unk> on the door, just a couple of <unk> 
that shook the whole damned closet and might, <unk> break away the <unk> connections from the wall. The two little <unk> meant that he 
was getting impatient to have a crowd of customers waited on and that 
if he had to he would <unk> open the door and drag out, by the opposite 
door handle which she would be <unk> <unk> clerk it 
was who thought she could waste so much store time on the <unk> the hours were <unk> in the morning until eleven at night 
on <unk> and during <unk> and there were no chairs and you couldn't <unk> and the cooling was overhead fans and there was no <unk> 
or <unk> us, we three handled quite a few small <unk> from 
spot drawings for advertising agencies <unk> to magazine work and quick <unk> jobs. Each of us had his own <unk> <unk> George 
did wonderful complicated <unk> drawings like something out of a <unk> <unk> hundreds of delicate details <unk> into an <unk> <unk> and looking as if they had been done under a <unk> <unk> He also drew precise crisp <unk> which he sold to various literary 
and artistic <unk> <The New <unk> for instance, or <unk> I did book <unk> and covers for <unk> <unk> <unk> girls <unk> in corners of <unk> furnished rooms while at the <unk> daring the cops to take him, is the guy in shirt sleeves clutching 
a <unk> The book could be <The <unk> <unk> but 
it would still have the same jacket illustration. I remember once I 
did a jacket for <unk> <unk> the book was a fine historical novel 
about Edward /3,, and I did a week of research to get the details 
just <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> clothes. I 
even <unk> out the materials from which <unk> were <unk> <unk> <unk> covered with <unk> so I'd get the light <unk> <unk> <unk> the art editor, took one look at my finished sketch 
and said, <unk> doing, <unk> In the first place, it's <unk> 
in the second place, it doesn't look <unk> and in the third 
place, it would cost a fortune to <unk> in the first <unk> 
you've got six colors there including <unk> I said, "Mr& <unk> 
it is as authentic as careful research can make it". He 
said, "That may be, but it isn't authentic the way <unk> think. 
They know from their <unk> into television and the movies that <unk> in the middle ages had beautiful flowing <unk> like Little <unk> <unk> and only the <unk> had <unk> And girls couldn't 
have dressed like that- it isn't transparent <unk> 
In the end, I did the same old picture, the naked girl and the guy in 
the <unk> only I put a Lord Byron shirt on the guy, gave him a <unk> instead of a <unk> and painted in furniture from the <unk> of 
a costume <unk> <unk> was as happy as a <unk> <unk> <unk> he said.   As for <unk> he actually sold <unk> 
We all painted in our spare time, and we had all started as <unk> <unk> with <unk> but he was the only one of us who made 
any regular money at it. Not <unk> he sold perhaps three or four 
a year, and usually all to Joyce <unk> or her friends. He had style, 
a real inner vision of his very own. It was strange <unk> it 
reminded me of the pictures of a child, but a child who has never played 
with other kids and has lived all its life with adults. There was 
the <unk> of color, the freedom of perception, the lack of <unk> 
but with a twist that made the forms leap from the page and <unk> you in the eye. We used to kid him by saying he only painted 
that way because he was so <unk> It may have been true for all 
I know, because his glasses were like the <unk> of milk <unk> 
but it didn't prevent the paintings from being <unk> He also had, 
at times, an <unk> <unk> air like a <unk> he would 
look right through you while you were talking to him, and if you said, <unk> Christ's sake, <unk> you've got <unk> blue all 
over your <unk> he would smile, and <unk> and an hour later the paint 
would be all over his <unk> as well. Mrs& <unk> thought of 
him as her <unk> and she paid two to three hundred dollars for a <unk> It was all <unk> and Donald didn't need much to live <unk> 
none of us did. We shared the expenses of the <unk> and we all 
lived within walking distance of it, in cheap <unk> of one kind or <unk>   <unk> the life class was my <unk> or rather, <unk> <unk> but I was ripe for it, and the other two wouldn't 
have gone if I hadn't talked them into it. I wanted to paint again. 
I hadn't done a serious picture in almost a year. It wasn't 
just the pressure of work, although that was the excuse I often used, 
even to myself. It was the kind of work I was doing, the quality of 
the ambition it awoke in me, that kept me from painting. I kept saying, <unk> I could just build up a reputation for myself, make some <unk> <unk> get to be well known as an <unk> like Peter <unk> 
for <unk> then I could take some time off and <unk> <unk> was a kind of goal I set <unk> I had admired him 
long before I talked to him. It looked to me as though he had everything 
an artist could want, joy in his work, standing in the profession, 
a large and steady income. The night we first <unk> at one of Mrs& <unk> giant parties, he was wearing a brown <unk> jacket 
with silver buttons and a soft pink <unk> <unk> instead of a <unk> 
he wore a leather <unk> drawn through a golden ring in which was set 
a lump of pale pure <unk> This set his <unk> <unk> of texture 
and color, and another kind of <unk> as well, for his clothing and <unk> would have paid the <unk> rent for a year. He was <unk> years older than <unk> <unk> but full of spring and <unk> He didn't look like what I thought of as an old man, and 
his lively and <unk> speech made him seem even <unk> He was one 
of the most prominent magazine <unk> in <unk> you saw one 
of his paintings on the cover of one or another of the <unk> national <unk> every month. <unk> had included him in its <unk> American <unk> series and had <unk> him at his studio in 
the East <unk> the corner of it you could see in the photograph 
looked as though it ought to have <unk> in it painting the royalty 
of <unk>   I had a long talk with him. We went into Mrs& <unk> library, which had low <unk> all along the walls, 
and above them a <unk> <unk> a Jackson <unk> twelve feet 
long, and a <unk> <unk> with a yellow background, that looked like 
an <unk> from a <unk> <unk> The <unk> had <unk> made 
for Mrs& <unk> by Picasso himself. Like certain expensive restaurants, 
just sitting there gave you the illusion of being wealthy <unk> the course of our talk, <unk> mentioned that he 
spent part of each week <unk> "By <unk> I asked. "No, 
I take classes with different <unk> he said. "I don't 
think I've reached the point, yet, where I can say I know everything 
I ought to know about the <unk> Besides, it's important to the 
way a painter thinks that he should move in a certain atmosphere, an <unk> in which he may absorb the ideas of other <unk> as <unk> 
went to Italy to meet <unk> and <unk>   He made 
a circle with his thumb and fingers. <unk> isn't this big, 
you know. It doesn't embrace only the artist, alone before his <unk> 
It is as large as all of art, <unk> <unk> <unk> 
He threw his arms wide, his face <unk> "The artist is like 
a <unk> of a <unk> no, he is more than that, a <unk> <unk> 
in some vast <unk> One of these days, I'm going to organize 
a gigantic exhibition that will span everything that's being <unk> these days, from extreme abstract <unk> to extreme <unk> 
and then you'll be able to see at a glance how much artists 
have in common with each other. The eye is all, inward or <unk> <unk> what a title for the <unk> The <unk> is <unk> do you <unk> I asked. I was <unk> just listening 
to him made me feel <unk>   "I'm studying <unk> 
with <unk> he replied. "Maybe you know him. He teaches at 
the Manhattan School of <unk> I nodded. I had studied with <unk> 
ten years before, during the scholarship year the Manhattan gave me, 
along with the <unk> prize for my paintings of <unk> on 
Hudson Street. <unk> and I had not loved each other. "I'm also <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> he went on, "and twice 
a week I go to a life class taught by <unk>   <unk> <unk> I said. "My God, is he still <unk> He must 
be a million years old. I went to a <unk> of his work when 
I was <unk> and I thought he was a contemporary of <unk> <unk> <unk> laughed. "He's about <unk> 
now. Still painting, still a kind of modern <unk> beautiful <unk> of mountains and <unk> He even makes the city look like 
one of <unk> <unk> I've always admired him, and when I 
heard he was taking a few <unk> I went to him and joined his <unk> it sounds <unk> I said, "but suppose you 
don't think of yourself as an <unk> <unk>   "You're <unk> the <unk> he said. "He has the magical eye. And 
he is a great man. <unk> with him is <unk> And that's 
the trouble with so many artists today. They lack <unk> They 
sit 
alone in their rooms and try to <unk> and only succeed in <unk> 
themselves still farther from life. That's one of the reasons art 
is becoming a useless <unk> In the Middle <unk> in the <unk> 
right up to the early nineteenth century, the painter was a giant 
in the world. He was an <unk> a man who studied his trade and 
developed his <unk> the way a <unk> or a wood <unk> did. 
He filled a real need, showing society what it looked like, turning 
it inside out, <unk> its wars and its leaders, its <unk> and its <unk> reflecting its profound religious <unk> He was a <unk> 
they weren't afraid of the word, <unk> <unk> nature <unk> <unk> <unk> what you will, a member of every party 
and of no party. But look at us <unk> We hold safe little jobs <unk> <unk> ads or the <unk> incidents in trivial <unk> 
and most of our <unk> painting is nothing but picking the <unk> out 
of the <unk> so it can be <unk> in greater <unk> A bunch 
of amateur <unk> What we need is to get back to the group, to <unk> and <unk> to the cafe and the <unk>   He 
could certainly talk. The <unk> of the evening was that I got the 
address of <unk> <unk> or rather, of the studio in which 
he gave his classes, for he didn't work there <unk> and joined 
the life class, which met every Tuesday and Thursday from ten to twelve 
in the morning. It was an awkward hour, but I didn't have to <unk> any time <unk> and it only meant that sometimes I had to stay 
a 
couple of hours later at the drawing board to finish up a job. After 
a short time, both George and Donald joined the class with me so they 
wouldn't feel <unk> and we used to hang a sign on the door of the <unk> reading <unk> TO <unk> It was mostly for the benefit of 
the <unk> because hardly anybody else ever visited us.   In 
a way, <unk> was right. <unk> was the word for it. 
I don't know that it was always as <unk> as I had expected it 
to be. <unk> it was because <unk> himself wasn't what I anticipated. 
I had come prepared to worship at the feet of this <unk> 
and he turned out to be a rather bitter old man who smelled of dead <unk> that isn't quite fair. Actually, there was a lot 
of force in him, which is why I kept on in that class instead of <unk> 
after a week. <unk> a little thing to start <unk> the car <unk> where is the car <unk> she asked. "I can't 
find it in the glove <unk>   <unk> must have it", 
I answered readily enough, recalling her last visit.   <unk> 
she was frowning. "Why should Via have it"?   Had 
she forgotten she had signed the car away, that whatever they mutually <unk> had been divided among the <unk>   I was silent. I 
didn't want to <unk> things up.   "I drive my own car by courtesy 
of <unk>   "I'm sure she'd turn it over to you, 
if you'd <unk> You know that".   She looked as if she were <unk> me of some <unk>   "She must have taken the registration 
when she went to <unk> I'll call her".   "No, <unk> you. I want nothing of <unk>   Why should this 
suddenly <unk> her? Walter was giving me checks for my pay, the <unk> bills. Had she been in such a turmoil that this had slipped 
her <unk>   "What a fool I've <unk> she said quietly. 
"I knew all this, but I paid no attention. I don't even own the 
house I'm standing in. I was so sure it was all temporary **h that 
we would all <unk> and then the lawyer would tear up all those things 
**h   "It <unk> down down down and finally there is no 
way out. If I am not to be Mrs& Salter I am <unk> 
I suppose I should have paid attention to that <unk> <unk> 
but it seemed one of those extreme statements women under stress indulge 
in. I love you, I hate you, I feel like killing you and myself, 
and in the same sequence I love you I think you're the most wonderful 
the most noble and so on and on, meanwhile eating a good breakfast 
and dinner and enjoying living. So I went about my business. I made 
a lemon <unk> a light <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> some <unk> <unk> so there would be something nice in the <unk> for 
the <unk> "Don't <unk> <unk> she said. "I have these <unk> in town for Saturday, and I'll probably spend Sunday 
with <unk> or the <unk>   At last, I thought, she's <unk> her <unk> With this <unk> in London, and new faces 
about her there, she would soon be a more <unk> a wiser person, 
all the better for her stay out here. I felt more <unk> as if I 
had had a part in bringing her through to a greater <unk> of herself. 
And I went back to my own cottage to live my own little patch 
of life.   It was <unk> that evening, but the path to my house was 
so well <unk> that I could feel my way, accustomed as I was to 
the dense <unk> that rise from the <unk> <unk> of the river 
and sometimes last for days. In the morning the fog was still thick 
so that to go to the village I crept along with my headlights full <unk> did notice a <unk> of light from the big house through the <unk> but as I had left a light on in my own house because of the <unk> I assumed Mrs& Salter had done the same before she left for <unk> I did my <unk> had my dentist <unk> and from there I 
went to the women's lunch at our parish church where we discussed 
plans for the annual Christmas <unk> so that <unk> was beginning to <unk> when I drove home in the late afternoon.   But the next <unk> Sunday. Why, when I drove down to church, didn't it speak 
to me, seeing the lights still on and the day crisp and <unk> <unk> 
brought to the <unk> accused of murder or accident say they cannot <unk> and reading the accounts of their testimony you cannot believe 
that the mind can <unk> absent itself, <unk> When I came back 
from church at noon Mrs& <unk> was turning into the Salter <unk> 
Even at a car's length I could sense that something was wrong, 
and so I followed her up to the <unk> in front of the <unk> <unk> was waiting there on the steps and she came <unk> toward us.   "She's <unk> <unk> she <unk> 
and both women ran up to the house, and I followed.   The 
search began, in all the rooms, running upstairs, down, opening <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>   Everything was as 
I had left it the night before <unk> her <unk> and bag for town, 
her <unk> and dress and shoes laid out **h only her <unk> coat was <unk> And <unk>   Then the <unk> began. I, who until 
that day before had been Mrs& <unk> friend, her <unk> was the <unk> now. It was <unk> and Mrs& <unk> who were calling <unk> <unk> And when they spoke they spoke to each other and not 
to me. And after I brought them <unk> and coffee I had to go back 
to my place in the kitchen and wait.   <unk> in the kitchen 
I recalled every word Mrs& Salter said that could have been a sign 
to me. "If I am not to be Mrs& Salter then I am <unk> 
Why didn't that alarm me <unk> And when she returned from taking 
her guests back to New York she had said, "All they talked about 
was <unk> **h <unk> this, <unk> that **h When they know the <unk> will they drop away from me, will I become a <unk> And 
then I remembered a few years before after their return from a short 
trip to Rome I had heard her <unk> over and over again, "On the 
boat people liked me for myself".   I had made a habit of calling 
her at night from my <unk> just to <unk> The last night I 
had called, but the line was always busy and it <unk> me. I assumed 
it was one of those <unk> conversations with <unk> or <unk> 
she comfortable in bed. But it seemed not from what they were saying. 
Then was it a final desperate plea from her, to <unk> **h hanging 
on and on past any man's patience **h some final <unk> of <unk> 
@   She was found the day after at the bottom of the <unk> 
I tried to believe that what must have happened was that, <unk> <unk> by this telephone call or <unk> she walked out in the 
night, as she had a habit of doing. Sometimes she took the path that <unk> up around my cottage to the walk at the edge of the <unk> It's 
so romantic up there, she used to say, with the broad river <unk> 
in its <unk> like an enormous dark mirror and all the sounds of 
the night, so <unk> With all that warm rain and the fog it might have 
been as simple as a <unk> <unk> a <unk>   But I didn't 
really think it was as simple as that, nor did anyone else. When a <unk> brought her up in his arms, still, small, as if she were a 
child asleep, I began to <unk> with a terrible <unk> almost <unk> 
that I still cannot account for. Was it a <unk> release 
from the long strain of <unk> of those <unk> that at last the <unk> the will gives way? Or what was it that, before <unk> <unk> Walter and all, I began almost to dance with <unk> and 
cry out, "I knew she'd do it! I <unk>   Everyone stared 
at me and drew back. Their eyes turned cold and <unk> even <unk> And they have never changed.   At the same time that 
I thought 
I understood her at long last and <unk> her, <unk> this knowing 
had there burned <unk> by my pity a fire of <unk> an enduring <unk> that burst out in that ghastly <unk> Was that what had given 
way in me? Even now I am <unk> at how little anyone knows 
of what they really are. It is absurd of course to say that that one <unk> <unk> me from the family I considered my very own, but 
there it <unk> a cooling <unk> that broke our close connection with 
each other. At the time I was filled with <unk> at this <unk> 
but in the years since I have come to understand that the sight 
of me was painful to them after that <unk> In my person they would 
always remember that last long time of me alone with her, so if they 
told themselves that I could have prevented it, I can understand that 
by now and love them still, because everyone must <unk> have a <unk> 
for what is not to be <unk>   It is not their avoidance 
that <unk> it is when I meet someone who was a close friend of 
the <unk> and therefore of mine, and they nod to me so <unk> and walk <unk> 
that it <unk> I could tell them, but no one ever asked, why I had <unk> out so <unk> at the sight of her body. No, I forget 
Mrs& <unk> who had been away visiting a married daughter when 
it happened. She haunted <unk> she persisted in explaining how and why 
she had advised Mrs& Salter to return to the country.   "We 
all feel <unk> I turned away from her <unk> "It was <unk> <unk> She <unk> her <unk>   "What do you <unk> 
she <unk>   "Why put such a high value on being top <unk> I added. It was <unk> almost <unk> this harsh <unk> 
and she has never come to see me since.   But suppose she 
had not taken Mrs& <unk> advice and lived on like thousands 
of women in <unk> <unk> of love, hanging on to <unk> and <unk> and finally <unk> If she <unk> and in that final decision <unk> what, above all, all of us value, life itself, must she 
not have risen to her <unk> <unk> and <unk> her <unk> <unk> 
felt at last the passion of a great moral <unk> If they say I 
could have stopped her it is because they are ignorant of her last weeks 
of <unk> her search into herself and its <unk> I had cried out that I knew she'd do it, but without 
my fully realizing it at the time, it was a cry of triumph for her, praise 
at her <unk> from <unk> and <unk> and guilt. She was 
finally at rest in truth, of her own proud free choice. At rest with 
my darling <unk> the first Mrs& <unk> <unk> <unk> 
came home. The funeral service was in the house, the Methodist minister, 
how clean and glistening his <unk> and his neat body standing 
beside that <unk> with that doll inside, a stranger speaking to <unk> the old sacred words, and the rain <unk> <unk> in <unk> seven days of <unk> rain that turned the ground to <unk> so the <unk> had to be <unk> I waited. Then Via called to 
say they had decided to <unk> her- as they had <unk> the thought <unk> to my mind- and did I want to meet her at the funeral home 
the next morning.   The <unk> stood on <unk> in a corner of 
the long low dimly lit funeral <unk> on its dark shining surface the <unk> of white <unk> I had ordered. I <unk> just for decency I 
thought at the time, but found myself <unk> "Our Father which <unk> in Heaven **h" And it was only after that that something unlocked 
in me and I felt a <unk>   Via was in the parking lot when 
I went outside. Together we waited in her car until the <unk> moved 
out and we followed it down into the heavy traffic of New <unk> the time we arrived and entered the building sacred music 
was already swelling out into the <unk> auditorium with its <unk> <unk> of religious <unk> Again I felt impelled to <unk> 
and reached back and pulled Via down. Something would come into her 
heart **h if nothing else the sounds of <unk> would give her some <unk> 
"I had a rather small place of my own. A nice <unk> apartment in 
a place called the <unk> <unk>   <unk> she said, 
hardly listening as she studied her left <unk>   "And then 
I had another place farther downtown I used as a <unk> <unk>   "I'm not a man who has many close intimate friends, <unk> he said, wanting her to know all about him. "Oh, 
I'd drink with newspaper people. I think I was what you might call 
a <unk> man, and yet it was when I was alone in my <unk> doing 
my work, that I really felt alive. But I think a man needs at least 
one intimate friend to communicate <unk> <unk> he waited for 
her to turn, to ask a question. She showed no interest at all in the 
life he had led back home, and it hurt him a little. "Well, what 
about you, <unk>   <unk> she asked, turning slowly. 
"What about me"?   "Did you make friends <unk> <unk>   <unk> I imagine that as you grew 
up you were alone a lot. How about it"?   "I guess <unk> 
she said taking a <unk> from her <unk> When she had wiped some 
of the <unk> from her mouth, she stared solemnly at her image in the <unk>   "Are your people still <unk> he asked, trying 
to touch a part of her life <unk> hadn't <unk> so he 
could 
have something of her for himself. "You talk so well, <unk> 
he went on. "You seem to have read so much, you have a natural gift 
for <unk> he added, trying to <unk> her <unk> "You must have 
been good at history at school. Where did you go to <unk> is this"? she asked, turning <unk> "Don't 
you know all about me by this <unk> My <unk> Carla <unk> This 
is my town. I sleep with you. You know something more about me every 
day, don't you? Would you be happier if I made up some stories 
about my life, told you some <unk> Why are you trying to worry <unk>   "I'm not trying to worry you".   "Well, 
all right <unk>   The <unk> tissues she had been using had 
been falling on the floor, and he got up and picked up one, then another, <unk> she would notice what he was doing. At home he had been 
a clean orderly man, and now he had to hide his <unk> Was she just <unk> <unk> about everything but her physical <unk> he <unk> Would he have to clean up after her every day, clean the <unk> the <unk> and get down on his knees and scrub the kitchen <unk> then hang up her <unk> pick up her <unk> make the bed 
while she lay <unk> He straightened up, ready to vent his <unk> 
then grew <unk> If he <unk> on the <unk> he suffered 
he would lose all respect for her, and without the respect he might lose 
his view of her, too.   "What's the <unk> she asked <unk>   <unk> Nothing at all", he said quietly. "Let's 
go out".   "Are those the only shoes you have, <unk> the matter with <unk>   "The 
heavy thick <unk> Look at them".   "They're an expensive 
English shoe for walking around a lot. I like them".   <unk> 
no one around here <unk> such heavy <unk> Can't you get another <unk>   "Maybe I <unk> he said, surprised that she 
could turn from herself and notice anything about him. "I'll get 
an elegant pair of <unk> Italian shoes tomorrow, <unk> I don't know why you want to go on wearing that <unk> 
she said, making a face.   "What's the matter with it"? 
He had put on the gray jacket and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> shirt he had worn that first night in Rome when he had <unk> her on the street.   "Oh, <unk> You look like a <unk> <unk> Can't you wear something else and look a little 
more as though you <unk>   "I don't mind at all", 
he said, delighted with her attention. <unk> his clothes, he put 
on his <unk> <unk> suit, and laid away the gray jacket with the 
feeling that he might be putting it aside for good. But it was a hopeful <unk> he told himself. She no longer wanted anything about him to <unk> her of the circumstances of their meeting that first night in <unk>   That day they <unk> around, just getting the feel 
of the city. They looked at the <unk> of the old Roman wall on the lower <unk> <unk> then they went to the <unk> <unk> She had some <unk> <unk> about the <unk> in the old days. Then they took 
a taxi to <unk> "There's a church you should see", she 
said. And when they stood by the fountain in the <unk> looking at <unk> Maria he had to keep a straight face, not letting on he had been 
there with <unk> He let her tell him all about the church. Then 
they had dinner. All evening she was eloquent and pleased with herself. 
When they got home at midnight she was tired out. And in the morning 
when he woke up at ten the church <unk> were <unk>   He 
had never heard so many <unk> and as he lay there <unk> he thought 
of her <unk> him for his remarks when he had looked up at the <unk> and the church at the top of the Spanish <unk> It was a good 
thing that she clung to her religion, he thought. She might like to 
take him to St& <unk>   <unk> wake up", he said <unk> her. "It's ten o'clock. <unk> you going out to <unk> 
You could take me to St& <unk>   <unk> she <unk>   "Come on, you'll be <unk>   "I think 
I'll sleep in this <unk> she said <unk> and as she <unk> 
against him, he wondered if she ever went to church. Why did he 
want her to go to <unk> he wondered **h Probably because it was 
a place where she might get a feeling of certainty and security. It would 
be good for her. It was too bad he had no feeling himself for church. 
Not his poor mother's <unk> She would have been better off 
if she had stuck to her Bible. As for himself, he just didn't have 
the <unk> for it. From the time he had been at college he had 
achieved a certain <unk> and <unk> by accepting the fact that 
there were certain things he could never know. Then he thought of those 
Old Testament figures on the ceiling of the <unk> <unk> Just 
figures out of a <unk> <unk> Could he honestly believe it would 
be good for Carla to have those old <unk> gripping her imagination <unk> Being a woman though, she would take only what she needed 
from church. It was too bad he wasn't a Catholic himself. Or a <unk> or one of those amusing <unk> <unk> or a strict orthodox <unk> What was the matter with him that they all <unk> <unk> It was the times, he was sure. All the <unk> changing from 
day to day, right under his eyes, so how could a man look to any one 
of them for an <unk> of his <unk> It was all too <unk> <unk> somewhere else. But <unk> Just the same, he thought, <unk> 
over it, it would be a good thing for a girl like Carla if she 
got up and went to church.   A half hour later he got her up to 
go out for breakfast so the <unk> hearing them <unk> down the <unk> would think they were going to a late <unk> It seemed to him 
that if the <unk> felt sure of them, could place them, it would 
help him to feel more sure of himself with <unk>   <unk> we're 
having coffee with them this <unk> he said, "I think 
I'll ask the daughter if we can pay her to come in every day to clean 
for us". And he waited for her to say, "Oh, no, I can do it, <unk> There's so little to do".   "Why <unk> she said. <unk> not good at that kind of thing".   "This afternoon 
let's take an air with them. Let's be fine superior people of 
great <unk> he said as if he were <unk>   "If <you> 
find it necessary, <unk> go <unk> she said, turning on the <unk> 
"I am what I am. I can't help it". Her words remained with 
him, <unk> him for hours. He didn't know how she would behave with 
other people.   When they walked into the <unk> apartment, 
the old lady, <unk> and <unk> said softly. <unk> and 
put 
out her hand. Her little brown face wrinkled up, her brown eyes <unk> 
and with her little <unk> she said all the <unk> things. <unk> <unk> too, said, <unk> and then more slowly, "I 
am <unk> And they sat down and began their little coffee party. 
The <unk> offered them <unk> with the coffee. Acting only as <unk> <unk> her hands folded on her <unk> was utterly <unk> 
She would turn to them, then turn to him, then turn again. <unk> 
her, he felt like a spectator at a tennis game, with the ball being <unk> back and forth. <unk> <unk> <unk> her head <unk> 
asked Sam about Canada, having a special interest. Carla <unk> 
The old woman had a <unk> from North Italy, a poor boy from 
a lumber mill who had got tired of the seasonal <unk> and who 
had <unk> to Canada to work on the <unk> For a year the boy 
had lived in the bush in a <unk> Did many of <unk> <unk> live 
in <unk> in the <unk> Had Sam ever lived in a <unk> she 
wanted to know. <unk> Sam explained that he had no experience 
with <unk> Just the same, the old woman said, she would write to her <unk> in his <unk> and tell him she had met a nice man from his adopted <unk> And Sam <unk> her, and hoped he might meet her <unk> 
back home, and asked her if she had any further news of the <unk> very great <unk> this one, the old woman explained, her black 
eyes <unk> An <unk> But very <unk> too. It was 
said that he had had a vision. Just as thousands that day in <unk> 
had seen the sun dancing in the sky, he had seen the same thing later 
in his own garden, and she turned to <unk> for <unk> <unk> 
had been sitting quietly, listening with the <unk> of the <unk> 
Now a little flush came on her pale homely face and <unk> in 
her eyes. The Holy Father would die soon, she said to <unk> so she 
could translate for <unk> although he had a brilliant doctor, a man 
who did not need the assistance of those doctors offered by the great <unk> of the world. Yes, the Pope could die and quickly be made a <unk> No, he was indeed a <unk> now. <unk> <unk> and swelling 
with importance, the old lady whispered <unk> There was 
a certain <unk> among the <unk> The <unk> in the <unk> 
of his great <unk> had neglected them a little. There would be changes <unk> and <unk> Raymond should understand that when the Pope 
died it was like the end of a regime in Rome. <unk> would be lost and 
new faces would become <unk>   Did <unk> Raymond <unk> <unk> he did, Sam said <unk> trying to get <unk> <unk> Surely she could see that these women were her <unk> too, 
he thought. <unk> orthodox and plain like a family she might meet in <unk> or <unk> or <unk> But <unk> eyes were on <unk> 
whose glowing face and softening eyes gave her a look of warmth and <unk> 
And <unk> watching in <unk> turned to <unk> "It means 
so much to her. It's like a <unk> I <unk> she said in a <unk> <unk> one night <unk> moved in the direction of the women's <unk> where <unk> of Night had gone to <unk> herself.   With

not even the evil spirits which kept her company in her time of <unk> her come, he caught his breath, feeling his heart <unk> in him, and turned away, afraid now. Even he, wanting her, <unk> of her and not knowing how to press his suit, feared the evil <unk> 
in her <unk> more. His breath <unk> and, <unk> he 
closed his eyes and stumbled off. <unk> he saw as often before some <unk> hideous yellow face over his head, shining and weird like the

which had invested him at other times like those that appear 
sometimes near the <unk> when they are perhaps pressed by the <unk> cried out to her, his back <unk> Then he <unk> not 
waiting to see if she <unk> him or took notice of his cry.   But 
she heard him go. Yet she did not hesitate and only turned slightly, 
her neck tall as she looked in his direction, and continued on her way 
toward the end of the camp.   <unk> others heard and stopped 
and <unk> the women peering from their <unk> then gathering in 
small, curious <unk> Early Spring came from her bed, from beside 
her <unk> husband, <unk> and stood at the entrance way to 
her <unk> hearing the mild <unk> the sound of <unk> <unk> <unk> 
there she saw <unk> of Night come through the trees and stop 
beside the <unk> silent, almost <unk> her body <unk> simply standing 
without speaking or moving while the wife of <unk> <unk> perhaps <unk> the dread that moved in her. When at last she could suffer 
the insult no longer, nor face the girl's <unk> she said in a 
voice <unk>   "I shall call your <unk> Go back where 
you can bring no <unk> or I will go and get the old man from his bed 
so he can see your <unk>   But the girl said only, "Tell

in the old man and the fury beyond it and sank into the darkness of her <unk> where <unk> <unk> <unk> sitting up in a half <unk> 
to say:   "What <unk> thing <unk> I thought I <unk> of <unk> <unk> But she went to him and pressed herself 
against his <unk> <unk> the <unk> odor of the whisky he had <unk> from <unk>   She said, "There is nothing 
that concerns you here. <unk> back and go to sleep. But do not dream. 
Do not let the <unk> spirits enter your <unk>   He sank back, <unk> and was soon asleep again.   <unk> the old man, 
beyond all the <unk> of the spirits his daughter <unk> went to her and <unk> the <unk> <unk> of his fingers in her hair and turned her 
and pushed her <unk> ahead of him into the trees where the moon sent 
out a thousand arms. And, <unk> her against a <unk> her back to 
him, he <unk> with the whip and made it <unk> and crack in the damp <unk> <unk> its arc until it narrowed to her flesh and the sound 
of it snarled and <unk> settling its own cruel demons on her shoulders 
while she stood as <unk> as dark and <unk> as <unk> her 
eyes open and staring at the pale <unk> of the bark so close 
to her face.   She said to him, her father, "How was I <unk> 
in pain or <unk> Is it for me to be forbidden the flesh you made 
grow on me? They all know your foolish <unk>   She stared 
at the pale <unk> on the tree, hearing her breath <unk> from 
it, her face close and touching at time the rough edges of the <unk> 
She felt the lash bite and heard her father say in <unk> <unk> 
words which had no <unk> like, <unk> **h <unk> The 
sounds of an animal in rage and despair.   Suddenly the lash 
stopped fighting the air and she heard <unk> of <unk> say in his high, <unk> voice:   "Did you follow me to see my <unk> <unk> from the line or I will settle the whip on you **h. <unk> Do 
you hear the anger of the <unk> <unk>   <unk> the 
girl saw <unk> standing <unk> his narrow shoulders <unk> his 
arms hanging long and <unk> He said, "Let me take her <unk> 
for there are demons in me <unk>   Then, without knowing why, 
she found herself running from them, fleeing wildly through the trees, <unk> her own shadows until she came to a little hollow in the rocky 
ground with a big stone in the center behind which she knelt and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of her heart and wanting for once to cry. <unk> a while the young men waited outside the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in his harsh language as he talked with himself. 
He shouted like a <unk> old <unk> his hair stiff and <unk> 
He <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of his <unk> walking in circles 
in and out of his living place, drinking stolen whisky in great, <unk> <unk> until finally, <unk> and sick, he fell into his 
own <unk> He amused the young men who had been silent long enough. 
But they could taste the <unk> of violence and <unk> 
through his <unk> Now they moved, rubbing their flesh alive again, <unk> the gloom they saw in the faces around them.   They 
came out and held their games and <unk> It was they who held the 
future in their hands. They went into the sun together and <unk> <unk> 
in their war clothes, painting their faces with the sacred <unk> <unk> far off in the cave of <unk> They danced the <unk> <unk> at night, the war dance, and <unk> their <unk> in the <unk> 
of <unk> and rode their horses in swift <unk> firing their 
few guns in <unk> at some <unk> signal.   <unk> 
was among them, and <unk> and they wore red blankets which flew like 
broad wings in the air of their passing. And a very young one, <unk> <unk> tried to <unk> them and followed <unk> <unk> <unk> 
was there, <unk> of the young chief by an older brother long dead, 
in whom also the <unk> <unk> of youth worked. He would spring <unk> upright suddenly after sitting quietly with <unk> because 
something had boiled over in his <unk> <unk>   All the 
young men, <unk> among them, challenged them in matched <unk> They <unk> and <unk> for war, swinging their horses in single file 
and then <unk> like <unk> At times they would ride <unk> through 
the camp, letting the women see their <unk> how handsome they 
were in their <unk> Then again they would stand in circles making 
other <unk> They <unk> their hair and <unk> it at the part 
and <unk> the <unk> so that the hair above their <unk> stood <unk> like the <unk> of <unk> <unk> making love.   <unk> <unk> 
his <unk> with <unk> knowing the girl watched from her place in 
the trees. He saw himself in a superior <unk> and he was as a <unk> arrow from the <unk> <unk> hurtling with a mad grace, his <unk> <unk> and <unk> with meadow <unk> He was always aware of the women's 
eyes which followed him, <unk> him. And the <unk> <unk> 
eyes of <unk> of <unk> And those of Early <unk> haunted 
and now 
full of hurt and <unk> He felt so much like <unk> even 
like shouting and crying out from the <unk> from which he could <unk> 
as an <unk> in a mad <unk> from the <unk>   He and <unk> <unk> a great parade with the young men. They would give one final <unk> of their challenge to let the people see their <unk> 
They would ride with streaming <unk> their colors <unk> in the <unk> shouting the last <unk> of a nation in the <unk> of <unk> so the sun came up again and for a moment its color was 
the young men's blood, shifting then into the full heat and <unk> 
which ran with their hearts. They mounted their horses and rode off 
into the hills. <unk> young chief stared at the wall of his <unk> <unk> The sound rose on the other side of the hills, vanished 
and rose again and he could imagine the <unk> <unk> <unk> of 
the <unk> horses the white men once had called the <unk> of <unk> 
He saw them in fleet images as they came rolling and now burst across 
the <unk> <unk> then with the others, peering into the sun, 
he saw the bright, <unk> <unk> their hair flying like dark <unk> 
only the <unk> the roll of <unk> the mad <unk> of the <unk> accompanying them. They leaned into the wind and seemed like one <unk> <unk> hurtling and <unk> until suddenly they rose 
straight in their <unk> and in one <unk> voice shouted, <unk> 
their <unk> cry of <unk> was moving through a screen of <unk> in among the white <unk> and <unk> The sounds from the <unk> began to <unk> in her <unk> She <unk> 
once more <unk> She had never been here at this <unk> She felt as if some dark, totally unfamiliar shape would <unk> 
at her <unk> but she found the path she always used, the <unk> of branches 
she had <unk> those she had pushed <unk> and she walked easily 
now, and more slowly, until she could see the dark <unk> of water <unk> her.   If I ever committed <unk> she thought, I 
would dive straight down from <unk> and no one would find me for days. 
She smiled, and <unk> let herself <unk> holding this known <unk> or that, her <unk> sliding in the <unk>   She jumped 
out onto the flat <unk> of rock and, <unk> herself, shook her <unk> <unk> hair and tilted her chin far upward. The <unk> music of the <unk> had <unk> but presently it began again, growing in volume until 
it was <unk> Julia felt at peace and drew her legs up and <unk> 
her hands tightly around the bent <unk> She had accomplished a <unk> 
This was <unk> place. The hour couldn't change it **h. <unk> <unk> her thoughts were a little <unk> They were becoming <unk> Perhaps it was because it was so late, and because she had 
no business to be here now.   She was thinking of Paul a few 
weeks ago, in the Easter <unk> with her at one of those awful Friday <unk> <unk> Class parties her mother had made her <unk> <unk> <unk> how are you"? **h And then off he went so <unk> 
to someone else with <unk> better developed, more obvious in a <unk> dress, someone without a <unk> of wire bands and an inability 
to find words that would hold him. I wish he was with me now, she <unk> and that we were both the ages we are and doing what was once 
only <unk> and acute <unk> <unk> <unk> I wish I were 
older or <unk> Julia <unk> thought. I wish so much someone <unk> 
me. 

#CHAPTER <unk> <unk> remembered seeing the door 
open sometime during the <unk> <unk> in a white <unk> standing 
like a ghost at the <unk> She had <unk> he must have slept 
again. He was staring at the blue <unk> lamp left on beside him. 
It seemed too much trouble even to reach for the <unk> but of course 
the impossible effort of leaving would have to be made on this Monday <unk> This room was like a prison. He would not be indebted 
to <unk> Below him, as if at the end of some remote <unk> he heard 
the humming of a vacuum <unk> His fingers <unk> across the <unk> 
They had left both of his eyes uncovered **h. Well, he told himself, 
let's put the show on the road.   He was walking across 
to the bathroom. He drank a glass of water and gripped the sink with 
both hands. A fearful pain had come from his head, as if the water 
were <unk> up through the blood vessels and expanding them **h. He 
recognized 
his jacket and <unk> The fabric was <unk> the <unk> weren't 
too <unk> and there were his shoes, thank God, but his shirt 
was one terrible mess.   He <unk> and then tore away the <unk> parts and wound the rest around his neck like a <unk> <unk> would be amazed to find him gone. <unk> would have to understand. 
She must have put his clothes in the <unk> He found a lump rising 
in his throat because of that one simple act of <unk> He was on 
the <unk> of tears. Alex <unk> in a fashion he owed a debt 
to that <unk> <unk> At least Alex had told him he wasn't dying. 
Perhaps George <unk> would be better off dead.   What 
time was it? He peered at his <unk> <unk> it was still <unk> 
A quarter to <unk> Too early for a vacuum <unk> but probably <unk> wanted the whole house in order before he came <unk> He 
was <unk> to tie his <unk> His fingers felt <unk> thick 
and <unk> He rose slowly and looked into the mirror on the inside of 
the closet door. He barely knew himself. This was some <unk> two <unk> of <unk> tape across his nose, like ugly roots from the mass 
of <unk> suddenly moist over his <unk> The surface, however, 
was perfectly white.   He was drinking another glass of water. 
It was after seven o'clock. He was supposed to be in court this afternoon, 
at City Hall. Who would take <unk> He'd have to think, 
but the main thing, the imperative necessity, was to leave before Sam <unk> was up and about, and before <unk> <unk> him with <unk> entered the <unk> He was actually walking down the <unk> A plane up in the sky, above the <unk> and this <unk> <unk> of a man desperately trying to get away.   <unk> is 
that you"? The voice issued from the <unk> of the hall below. George 
did not reply. "Is that you, <unk> **h <unk> <unk> a moment he felt like a <unk> <unk> Then Julia 
appeared under the arch leading to the dining room. She stood gazing 
at him.   <unk> <unk>   He was trying to smile 
at her.   <unk> You shouldn't be up, should <unk> I was just leaving here, <unk> **h. I'm all set. Just 
about to call a <unk>   She was wearing some sort of gray <unk> She seemed overly tall, her <unk> knitted in concern. "Well, 
at least you won't have to do that", she was saying. "I'm 
about to leave myself. I'll drop you off".   <unk> <unk>   "I'm going back to <unk> she answered. <unk> driving me. I'm just finishing breakfast **h. But 
have you told Mother you were <unk> she asked him.   "No 
**h. I just don't want anyone <unk> <unk> That's my <unk> 
It's quite a big one", he added.   Her face seemed to <unk> in an <unk> bright shaft of sunlight. "Well, won't you 
come in then, have a cup of <unk> or <unk> **h Or maybe 
a <unk> she asked, in a way that seemed <unk> sophisticated, <unk> 
and yet perhaps partly <unk> He tried to see her face 
more <unk>   <unk> nothing at all", he said after a moment's <unk> "I'll just wait for you here".   He leaned 
his head against the wood <unk> behind him, but the vivid red <unk> of pain inserted themselves against his <unk> He raised them. <unk> moved past.   "I have to say <unk> <unk> I won't 
be <unk>   "As a great <unk> <unk> he said, <unk> 
don't mention you've seen me".   "Not to <unk> please **h. "I'll call your mother as soon as 
I get home. It'll be so much <unk>   "All right **h" 
She was staring at him.   "I'm fine, <unk> **h. <unk> 
you just go <unk>   She had disappeared. He could feel a <unk> <unk> against the <unk> He imagined <unk> voice: <unk> 
what the hell goes <unk> I wouldn't have the strength 
to answer, he thought. Maybe I couldn't have called a <unk> could hear the <unk> <unk> He saw the <unk> which <unk> was <unk> He stood up.   "I'll take that, <unk> 
for you".   "Oh <unk> she said. "I can <unk> went ahead of him. Outside the Lincoln was <unk> He could 
hardly believe he was getting in. <unk> was gazing at him in an <unk> <unk> <unk> but that didn't matter.   We'll 
drop Mr& <unk> off in <unk> Julia said, and for the <unk> 
second George was reminded of her father's tone with <unk> 
To the manner <unk> odd to have such a thought at a time like <unk> 
yet her <unk> seemed forced or <unk> He could not stop 
to <unk> He had never felt particularly close to her. <unk> seemed 
more <unk> but obviously Julia had respected his <unk> 
He took her hand.   "I wish I didn't have to go back to <unk> 
she said, and then, "I wish you lived in New York. That's 
in the opposite <unk>   "I wish I <unk> he <unk> 
"I wish I wasn't wearing this ridiculous <unk> and that 
we could go to a theater together, or a nice restaurant, forget we 
knew **h" He stopped <unk>   <unk> we ever knew <unk> just sort of everything in <unk>   She 
said nothing until <unk> had <unk> their pace. "I know you 
feel <unk> but that sounds like such a <unk> thing for <you> to <unk> it"? he asked. "Yes, <unk> I'm supposed 
to joke about things, aren't I? **h But sometimes life 
can 
be rather a <unk> <unk>   His voice seemed thick 
and <unk> He <unk> her hand. He could see the stone building 
where he <unk> Just a few more steps **h. <unk> he reached 
into his pocket. Yes, there was the key.   "Are you positive 
you'll be all right by <unk> she asked him.   For a 
moment he smiled. "Yes, <unk> <unk> You've done me the greatest 
possible service. By myself I'll be <unk>   "Take care 
of yourself <unk>   "I will **h. you, also **h. don't work 
too <unk>   It was an automatic <unk> as he crossed through 
the courtyard he regretted it. He should have discovered a more <unk> <unk> Someone shouted at him, <unk> Will you look 
at George <unk> What happened to you"?   "I <unk> 
into a door <unk> George said.   Someone laughed. George 
walked steadily ahead into his <unk> His <unk> seemed on fire. 
He had shut his door with the brass number screwed to it. In the <unk> 
the raw whiskey made him <unk> Just one or two <unk> he 
told himself, enough to <unk> some of the pain.   He was <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm home **h. No, really, right as rain 
**h. Tell Sam not to worry about the car. I'll get it hauled away 
**h. <unk> <unk> no visit <unk> I'll be asleep **h. For God's <unk> don't <unk> That <unk> me more than anything **h. Yes, <unk> 
I'll see the <unk> this evening, if you insist **h". 
There was one more call to make.   <unk> did I wake you"? 
he asked. "Yes, I thought you'd probably be up **h. <unk> <unk> 
some fool was **h. happened to be driving somewhat <unk> 
last night. <unk> it turned out to be me, but I wouldn't 
quite put it that way to the boss **h. <unk> hell no, I'm not in a <unk> 
I won't be in town for a couple of days, though, and there's 
that case I was supposed to handle this afternoon. Too bad a jury 
isn't involved. I might struggle in for a jury. I'd win hands down. 
But I thought maybe Tony <unk> could <unk> for me. He'll <unk> you might give him sort of a <unk> <unk> He's 
got all the facts. I wouldn't want to ask for a <unk> it's 
really just a routine thing **h. <unk> **h No, darling I'd 
rather 
you didn't come out". A smile pulled at the lower strip of <unk> <unk> "Don't even send flowers. I'll see you <unk> 
I'll <unk> you with a <unk> He was about to say <unk> <unk> but thought better of it. "I'll take you out to dinner. <unk> <unk> had put down the <unk> A strange relationship 
between Joan <unk> and himself. Who knew about it? 
She lived alone in the older part of the city, in one of those <unk> 
houses whose brick <unk> some early <unk> had <unk> She 
had two tiny rooms on the second floor. She was a clever girl, a most <unk> <unk> She let him come and go as he <unk> or as 
it pleased her. In the office you might have thought them only casual <unk> yet 
if he said: Make an excuse yourself, come out here today, 
she would have been on the next <unk> and, <unk> if she had 
been in need, he would have gone to her. 
"They make us <unk> look <unk>   "That's a peculiar 
way to <unk> It wasn't just the <unk> birds that had <unk>

"I love you. <unk> <unk>   Lucy <unk> Obviously, Susan was not. <unk> busy feet, <unk> like <unk> <unk> around her <unk> Susan would be visiting her <unk> for only a few days, but 
even at seven she was a <unk> <unk> she always packed for a <unk>

he said. <unk> wanted me to thank you for taking <unk> It'll be

but even so, she wants you to know that she's <unk> <unk> did not believe him; Myra appreciated nothing. Jim had 
put the thanks in his <unk> mouth.   <unk> she 
said, and the single word mingled love and <unk> in an equal <unk> <unk> should have told me herself. And <unk> it be only a 
couple of <unk> <unk> what happened the last <unk> <unk> Cathy with them, Myra had gone out to the Coast for a supposedly

he added, "I wish you'd think what it must be like for her 
to be without <unk> to be a new widow, a young <unk>   "It 
depends on the <unk> Lucy had an idea that Myra loved it. And 
not for one moment did she believe that Myra had settled down. It 
seemed to Lucy that all their married life, she and Jim had been doing

way of life. <unk> that succession of <unk> she now considered <unk> an ominous <unk> on her horizon.   It was 
not that she disliked <unk> The youngster drew her, troubled her <unk>

she said <unk> "if Myra tried to leave her with us <unk> <unk> loved big <unk> thousands of miles <unk> in Paris,

knew her too well to find it impossible.   "That's a horrible 
thing to accuse her <unk> Jim was so indignant it was obvious that 
no matter what he said, he too had seen the looming <unk> of a <unk> 
He went to the foot of the stairs and shouted up, <unk> <unk> <unk> Get <unk>   A startled piping 
sound <unk>   "Don't yell at <unk> Lucy said. Was 
it only a few nights ago that they had been standing together in front 
of the house looking at the <unk> <unk> Their arms around

their talk and their feeling had been as deep and warm, as <unk> in <unk> as the air around them. Then, from within the still, sleeping 
house, the telephone had <unk> <unk> with her news, was on the other

at her. His dark <unk> which had been lowered in anger, <unk> <unk> he said. "There isn't a chance of <unk> letting 
anything like that happen. Let's stay <unk>   But they <unk> just friends, Lucy <unk> they were husband and wife, 
and Myra had no right <unk> and <unk> their marriage. The only 
thing that had ever come between them was that <unk> selfish sister

because Susan was <unk> down the stairs. <unk> 
looked like an <unk> baby <unk> her arms were straining with 
a burden of <unk> "I'm <unk> she announced.   "Do you

will be here to play with you. <unk>   "No", Susan 
said, <unk> with her <unk> <unk> of dolls with a <unk> <unk>   And at this point, Lucy thought, there should be 
a lecture on little <unk> sharing <unk> but she could sympathize 
with <unk> there ought to be a limit to <unk> too. 
That was one more reason she didn't look forward to <unk> <unk> 
short or <unk> the last one had been a <unk> war. She suspected 
that Cathy had been competing with Susan for attention that she 
had never had.   "Well", Jim said, out of the silence, <unk> 
get going, dolls and all".   When the car, with <unk> 
hands waving wildly from the rear window, disappeared down the <unk> Lucy stood looking after its pale dust. The day was brilliant 
around her- <unk> crisp with <unk> yet her inner turmoil <unk> it. She had let Jim go with a <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> She was sorry, and angry at herself, because never in their 
life together had she done that. She turned and began to walk toward 
the house.   At the feeding station, the <unk> group of <unk>

life ought to be, a new <unk> lively with <unk> <unk> and hanging 
from the ceiling was an <unk> Mother <unk> <unk> spinning slowly 
in the <unk> A row of little <unk> waited for a child's clothes 
in the neatly empty <unk> since Myra had always put most of <unk> money on her own back, Lucy suspected that no more than a

with <unk> and as Lucy shut the door an unhappy memory slipped into 
her mind, like a <unk> <unk> Greg's house, on the day he 
was <unk> and the child, pale, silent, <unk> watching the funeral <unk> with <unk> eyes. Many times since his death that memory had <unk> and troubled her.   Out in the hall, the upstairs phone <unk> and the small ghost <unk> When she picked up the <unk>

had given him for his last <unk> and himself quite thoroughly

to mark the end of a long, <unk> chapter in the social life of 
the community. Linda looked remote yet lovely in black, and everyone 
held his or her breath.   Not that Linda was <unk> not that 
she would do anything <unk> or in bad taste any more than John <unk> would. <unk> Linda been a perfect wife to <unk> who 
was the least bit of a disappointment all these <unk>   Wasn't 
John Cooper even more attractive at <unk> than he had been <unk> years <unk> And wasn't John's wife, <unk> 
even more <unk> if <unk> <unk> John <unk> after all 
this time, deserve something better of life? Wasn't it adult and <unk> to look at it that way? And <unk>   Everybody 
knew that John Cooper had married Edythe on the <unk> It was 
the kind of thing that could ruin a man's life, and it was a tribute 
to John's strength of character and very real business ability that 
it hadn't ruined his. "Of course, there was nothing you could <unk> but you still ought to be ashamed of yourself for letting it <unk> <unk> Chandler said to Linda <unk> <unk> <unk> Linda 
accepted the <unk> which was something she did rarely in all 
her life and most rarely in that summer of <unk> when she was by all odds 
the <unk> and <unk> young woman west of the <unk> Mountains, 
and John was surely one of the <unk> and brighter young 
men around <unk>   For it had been John and Linda ever 
since she had come out two seasons before at the Golf Club to the <unk> <unk> not only of the stag line but even of her fellow <unk> John had claimed her from the stag line, a young man a year out 
of Dartmouth with <unk> <unk> still around his eyes.   You 
saw them always together those years. You talked about <unk> 
as an <unk> <unk> were at <unk> <unk> last <unk> <unk> drove to <unk> in three and a half hours. Then there 
was a <unk> over something, as there had been <unk> <unk> <unk> 
only this one didn't <unk>   You still said <unk> 
but as if you were speaking of a national <unk> such 
as the depression or <unk> It got worse instead of better. First, 
it came out after Mr& <unk> will was <unk> he had died 
the year <unk> that John and his mother weren't rich any more. 
And then there was <unk> engagement to Bobbie <unk> was no connection between the two events, because Bobbie wasn't <unk> either, though he was more aggressive than John. He was 
a bright and handsome young man from New York, who worked for the same <unk> company as John did.   Some people said Linda had just 
announced the engagement to <unk> John into some action, but when John 
came home from a business trip to Cleveland with <unk> with Edythe 
his bride, it could no longer be <unk> even to sentimental <unk> <unk> It wasn't even John and <unk> It was simply <unk> John.   There was nothing specifically wrong with <unk> 
but there was absolutely nothing right about her either. <unk> <unk> had been to school with her <unk> near Baltimore and 
tried to explain rather than defend her to the gang having lunch at <unk> you shouldn't <unk> <unk> <unk> said. "I know she gives the impression of being shallow and <unk> and <unk> She is <unk> and <unk> but 
she really isn't <unk>   Bobbie and Linda looked <unk> at their <unk> John was at the church with <unk> She <unk> during the <unk> and <unk> <unk> who was one of <unk> <unk> said John <unk> black as death at her. "As 
if he were <unk> she said. <unk> <unk>   Edythe 
settled down to become a social myth and a horrible example. Her hair 
never seemed to be in place and her <unk> were never quite the correct <unk> She didn't have a bad shape when you caught her at the <unk> at <unk> <unk> but her bathing suits were far from <unk> And 
you didn't see her much at <unk> <unk> or anywhere, for John had drifted 
away from the <unk> <unk> said it was because he was too proud 
to stand <unk> Others thought he couldn't stand seeing <unk> Mrs& <unk> <unk> still so beautiful, so much in command of <unk> were <unk> reasons too. John's mother 
died not long after his marriage, and there was even less Cooper money <unk> John sold the big old place in <unk> and bought a smaller 
house in <unk> <unk> He was not reduced to poverty, but his job 
at the steel company had become a real job and not a method of passing 
the day.   John was good at his job. It probably wasn't hard 
for him to keep his nose to the <unk> with nothing but Edythe 
to come home to. Though that may be unfair since Ben <unk> John's 
first son, came along early in <unk> the <unk> baby you ever saw 
and a blessing that he looked all Cooper from <unk> to pink <unk> <unk> a trace of <unk>   But the continuing charm of the other <unk> Sally in <unk> and Jack in <unk> and all John's success 
at his work only made <unk> <unk> and general <unk> 
more <unk> She never could fit into a crowd which had known, which 
still knew and admired <unk>   When there was bridge at <unk> 
house, the cards <unk> like wet <unk> <unk> and the food 
probably <was> wet <unk> <unk> She managed a missionary drive 
for the church once and got the books so confused that old Mr& <unk> the <unk> <unk> who'd never donated more than five dollars 
to anything, had to <unk> up five hundred dollars to avoid a <unk> 
in what Edythe called "the <unk> of the <unk> John did find 
the missing checks and money <unk> and the drive was actually <unk> 
which was a real bit of luck for the <unk> ## <unk> an intelligent man, John must have guessed what everyone thought 
about <unk> but he never let on by so much as a brave smile. Poor 
John was the kind of stock that keeps a <unk> without <unk> 
and maybe <unk> over backward to keep a bad one. He was an <unk> 
and generous husband, <unk> a lot of people felt, because they 
knew that money must be a problem to him. But he got ahead in <unk> 
on leave from his job to an important Washington assignment 
during the <unk> after the war back to the heir <unk> of the steel <unk>   The <unk> saw Bobbie and Linda <unk> but 
no more than was necessary. Bobbie had been successful, too, though he 
didn't match John's pace, and after all he didn't need to, with 
all the Stuart money. He and Linda settled down to being social <unk> and Linda managed to look a little more beautiful each <unk> then came the <unk> turn, the smashed <unk> and <unk> <unk> alone and <unk>   Everyone held his or her <unk> think Linda couldn't have got John back any time, 
if she'd <unk> <unk> <unk> who had been <unk> <unk> 
said between bites of a chicken sandwich at a luncheon table at <unk> <unk> "Now you know she <unk> but she isn't that kind of <unk> But now- well, it would be a <unk> I think. Poor <unk> Evans felt more wretched than she had ever dreamed <unk> death could move her to feeling. What she felt was a <unk> 
loss with a sense of waste to it, not so much sorrow for handsome, <unk> <unk> but for the lost years that had been brought into 
high relief by his death.   She knew what people were <unk> 
it was what she had been thinking herself. It was up to her to save <unk> John, dear John, to <unk> the wrong she had done, but she <unk> 
at the decision as at the <unk> of a cold stream.   There 
was no one who would blame her or <unk> she could be sure of that. 
It might be rough on Edythe at first, but Linda and John between 
them could make a settlement handsome enough to <unk> her, to send her 
back to Cleveland or <unk> And Linda felt capable of <unk> 
the affection of the children, anxious even, since she and Bobbie 
had had none of their own. It would be good for them to have a mother 
they need not be ashamed of.   Linda would have to wait, she <unk> 
But what was a decent six months or so after the more than twenty 
years gone <unk> <unk> of watching while Poor John struggled without 
the help and understanding of the kind of wife a man needed to get <unk> Of course, he <unk> done wonders **h. <unk> <unk> and 
regular <unk> had different sales departments at Smith + <unk> 
where John and Bobbie both worked. Bobbie had been head of the <unk> division, while John was just another good salesman in the regular <unk> So when old Mr& <unk> the company president, talked 
about putting in a single sales manager for both branches after the 
head of the regular <unk> had gone with <unk> it looked 
like the perfect chance for <unk> For Linda knew how to help her <unk> not just the <unk> contacts but also the little <unk> 
for <unk> <unk>   She was almost sick when Bobbie 
came home with the news that Poor John had won the job. "What did 
you do"? she asked <unk> "You must have done something, something <unk> Lord knows I had everything set for you".   Bobbie 
said something about damned <unk> sticking together, and <unk> got angry at him. They had their first real fight, and Bobbie 
went off to get drunk.   Linda <unk> her <unk> Donald <unk> 
into a lunch the next day to find out what had happened. He 
was a director of S& + M& and must have been in on the decision. 
But <unk> old Uncle Donald would tell her no more than that Bobbie 
had certainly been considered for the job, but there were factors in 
a large company which <unk> and even some <unk> couldn't <unk> didn't tell her of the long board meeting where <unk> and John were weighed one against the other.   "I'm 
behind John <unk> Mr& <unk> said <unk> "I think we're <unk> that he and Evans are equal in <unk> so we have to look 
at the thing in terms of <unk>   "Now, I believe Poor <unk> work just a little <unk> With that wife of his, I think 
he feels every chance he gets is his big chance. <unk> with Linda 
behind him, will have plenty of other <unk> And also, the 
money can't mean as much to <unk>   <unk> will take the 
job as his just reward and work hard at it; Poor John will take 
it as a miracle and have every other independent steel company sitting 
up nights <unk> about us".   Most of the directors nodded. <unk> Donald <unk> found himself nodding agreement too. 
After the surprise was over, Linda was almost as pleased as anyone 
with John's good luck, though she agreed with <unk> decision 
some months later to move to <unk> <unk> The job at <unk> wasn't 
particularly better, but it got him away from being subordinate to 
John and assured him steady <unk> since <unk> was owned to a 
large degree by various branches of <unk> family.   Poor John's 
rise continued to be <unk> When he was made a vice president 
only a year after the new sales job, a leading business magazine ran 
his photograph with a brief biography in a series on <unk> <unk> <unk> OF THE <unk> 
She called then to say she had a <unk> for that night. <unk> <unk> the chance to make some money. Such a nice little thing- 
lives right in the <unk>   "That's <unk> I 
said <unk> I could get along without that three dollars. In some 
ways it was worth being out the <unk> just knowing I was no longer <unk> to <unk>   It was past midnight and we were in 
bed when the phone <unk> I stumbled through the hall, wondering who would 
be calling at this hour. I answered to find Nadine at the other <unk> "You scared me half to <unk> I said <unk> "What's <unk>   <unk> nobody answers at the <unk> 
Her voice came <unk> "I'm absolutely <unk> That stupid girl 
might have gone off and left <unk>   "Oh, she wouldn't

had gone wrong at the apartment, and if I didn't go over, who <unk> <unk> <unk> WAS sound asleep, and I didn't see any 
sense in waking him. I dressed in the kitchen, then left a note on the 
table telling him what had happened. I drove off through the cool <unk> to <unk> apartment and rang the <unk> and in a few seconds 
a young girl opened the door. Her face was <unk> from sleep. "It's

to her voice now, as if she'd been <unk> <unk> <unk> 
I'll get him out of here as soon as I possibly can, but I don't

So I told her Mrs& Roberts would pay her in the morning, and she <unk> off to her own apartment.   After I looked in at <unk> 
I went into the living room and waited. I must have <unk> off, 
because I came to with a start at the sound of <unk> <unk> shrill 
with <unk> <unk> loud and <unk> As I went to the door 
I heard the clock strike two. I opened the door, and Wally stumbled <unk> <unk> as if Nadine had pushed him.   I had always thought

all right to go. I left her, a limp bundle of <unk> shivering 
with terror because her bubble had burst around her. Wally was <unk> 
on the <unk> I had done all I could. I had done all I was going

I drove home, found Chris still asleep. I <unk> up close to him- <unk> him- <unk> for a man like him. <unk> I wasn't <unk>   I kept on being <unk> In the afternoon Nadine and <unk> came over with <unk> Wally sat in our big chair, his hands

get straightened out".   <unk> out- They'd had 
years of making all that <unk> "I won't do it", I said <unk> <unk> was always too good to live in a little house like <unk> 
Well, now she can sleep in the street for all I <unk> isn't like you, <unk> Chris said <unk> 
Then I felt <unk> too. I didn't want to be like that, mean 
and <unk> But, <unk> it all, why <unk> we help a couple of <unk> <unk> who had looked down their <unk> at us?   But, in 
the end, we did. It just seemed as if there was nothing else <unk> do. 
The finance company took all their <unk> and they didn't 
have a cent to their name.   Then Wally got sick. To my way of <unk> he was scared sick. His luck had failed him, and it was easier 
to crawl off into bed than to get out and fight the world. <unk> made trip after trip in our old car, moving the clothes and dishes 
and the stock of <unk> Nadine had bought on special. At least <unk> <unk> I thought <unk> as I put all the food away. 
While I <unk> Nadine sat and cried. When she wasn't <unk> she 
was in our bedroom fighting with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> at him. "You're too <unk> to go out and look for 
another job. You're just a <unk> <unk>   It was a <unk> 
all right. But it couldn't go on <unk> A couple of weeks, <unk> had said. I figured I could stand practically anything for a 
couple of weeks.   But the two weeks dragged into <unk> and they 
were still with us. <unk> constant nagging had finally gotten <unk> out of bed. He set out every morning looking for work, and come 
home around noon, full of <unk> and <unk> Wendell <unk> had <unk> 
him. Nobody would even take his <unk>   "You 
can get <unk> Nadine would <unk> "You can get a job working 
in a grocery store, if nothing <unk>   "The high school <unk> have got everything <unk> up", he said, a <unk> in his voice. <unk> damn <unk> taking work away from men who need it". ## 
@ <unk> <unk> they'll be back in <unk> I'd say, 
trying to sound <unk> But this was only the middle of July <unk> I couldn't take six more weeks of this. I mentioned 
it to Chris one <unk> hot night, when I had slipped outside for 
a breath of fresh air. <unk> <unk> really believe in <unk> But I swear to 
you from the moment I opened my eyes, I knew it was going to be a 
bad day. Part of it was the weather, so <unk> it would take me twice 
as long to get to the hospital. Part of it was being so <unk> I'd 
not only had my usual full day yesterday, but a dinner meeting as well, 
that kept me up late. But the rest of it, the main part, wasn't 
based on logic at all. It was just going to be one of those <unk> the <unk> time, I wished I'd chosen some nice, <unk> <unk> profession. And for the <unk> time, I 
answered myself. I hadn't chosen <unk> <unk> had chosen <unk> I shouldn't <unk> I told myself in the <unk> <unk> I had a lot to be <unk> for. A profession that brought 
me as good an income as mine wasn't to be <unk> at. Maybe I 
didn't see as much of <unk> as I'd like, but how much worse it 
would have been if I'd had to board her out somewhere after Alice <unk> send my daughter to an <unk> or a <unk> At least, 
we were together and we had Mrs& <unk> bless her, to look after <unk> no mother could be <unk> of <unk> than Mrs& Hodges was. 
I 
was lucky in lots of ways, no doubt about it.   Especially in the 
way <unk> had turned out. <unk> up without a mother from the time 
she was <unk> it wasn't a good thing for a child, even knowing 
the kind of mother Alice had been. But I <unk> start on <unk> 
She is a closed book, a picture I keep on my <unk> but never look <unk> If she'd kept on as she'd been going, the story I'd told <unk> would probably have been true by now, <unk> **h   As usual, <unk> bright smile greeted me at the breakfast table. Her 
first class wasn't until <unk> but she always got up to have breakfast 
with me. It made me feel good and knowing that she'd decided, all 
on her own, to go to college right here in town made me feel good, too. <unk> I knew that I couldn't give myself all the credit for her <unk> I had a feeling that young Pete <unk> the most promising <unk> at <unk> had something to do with it, too.   She'd 
been out with Pete the night before and her gay chatter about 
their date <unk> my mood a little. But once I was alone again, 
driving 
to the hospital, the <unk> <unk> If she and Pete were 
really getting <unk> I'd have to do some hard thinking. Should 
I tell him the truth about <unk> Did he have a right to know the <unk> I'd kept from <unk> all these <unk>   The boys were 
already waiting in the corridor outside my office when I got to <unk> 
Two <unk> and Dick <unk> the other <unk> I'm Chief 
of <unk> here and this morning would start like all others, with 
me taking the boys on the <unk> Pete was down on <unk> Dick 
told me, and he'd meet us there.   There wasn't anything of 
special interest that morning, no one <unk> than they should have been. <unk> came to meet us when we stepped out of the elevator on <unk> 
he'd had a case of <unk> shock, but it was all taken care 
of now. Seven is a women's floor and, as it happened, not very busy 
right then. When we'd finished our regular <unk> Pete pointed 
me toward the small ward at the end of the floor.   <unk> a new 
one in last <unk> he said. "I haven't seen her yet, but I 
hear she's a <unk>   I wasn't <unk> The ward was 
a small one, four <unk> kept reserved for female <unk> We didn't 
get many at <unk> and they were never pretty <unk> It was 
thought wiser to keep them segregated from the patients in the regular <unk> <unk>   The moment I walked in, the whole miserable feeling 
of the day seemed to focus on the woman in the bed. They'd cleaned 
her up <unk> of course, and she'd pretty much slept off her drunk. 
But there was something about her- and I felt my lips forming 
a name. <unk> **h But this woman's name was Rose <unk> looked at the chart for <unk> Yes, Rose <unk> <unk> acute <unk> She looked about <unk> though I recalled 
that the chart gave her age as <unk> An ugly scar <unk> 
the somewhat familiar <unk> face, already <unk> by the <unk> <unk> of broken red <unk> that heavy <unk> <unk> Her coarse hair 
was <unk> <unk> blonde and its <unk> dirty <unk> <unk> could it <unk> No, no **h it was an unfortunate <unk> 
that was all it was, and I turned to <unk> forcing myself to put my <unk> out of my mind.   In a low voice, Dick filled us in 
**h <unk> <unk> picked up <unk> passed out 
in the doorway. Although quiet when they brought her in, she'd suddenly 
turned violent and had to be knocked out. It was the old story. <unk> keep her a day or two, and the <unk> people would talk to her. 
But if she wasn't <unk> she'd just go back to the same life <unk> left.   Turning toward the patient again, <unk> I can't <unk> what happened to me then, except to say that I felt sick. 
I tell you, it took every <unk> of control I had to be able to <unk> "Now, <unk> or is it <unk> <unk> 
I never 
liked going straight into an examination with <unk> it <unk> 
them, I've always thought, to <unk> first. This was one time I'd 
have <unk> broken my own rule, but habit was too strong. <unk> Her voice was flat and <unk> But those penetrating <unk> 
I had to turn my head away. It was then that I saw what the <unk> <unk> <unk> There were <unk> on the sheet. <unk> this"? I asked. "Your <unk>   She 
shook 
her head. "I been <unk> a little now and <unk> she said quietly, 
no emotion in her voice.   "Have you spoken to a doctor 
about it"?   Once again, there was a negative <unk> I told 
Miss <unk> to move her down the hall where we had an examining <unk> <unk> do a <unk> I told <unk> It was only a 
few moments before Miss <unk> had her in the proper position for 
a <unk> but I couldn't see anything wrong on gross <unk> <unk> stood by with a slide and took the <unk> sent it down to the <unk> 
with a request for the test. That done, I told Miss <unk> to 
take her patient back to bed and again put her out of my mind. 
I was busy the rest of the day. <unk> in the afternoon, I was up on <unk> again. One of my private patients was being admitted and I went 
in to see her <unk> On my way to the <unk> I ran into <unk> <unk> got the results on the <unk> <unk> <unk> he said. <unk> something there, all right. Class <unk> they said. 
Do you want to talk to her, <unk>   <unk> I <unk> 
I didn't ever want to see that woman again. But that was <unk> of course. "All right. We'll do a D& and C& and 
get her permission for a <unk> Maybe it's nothing, maybe 
it's <unk> or <unk> <unk> can't take any <unk> you can keep her here that <unk> Pete said <unk> <unk> 
tells me she's started <unk> <unk> wants to get out. <unk> to get to her <unk> I <unk>   I <unk> in <unk> 
"Well, better see what I can do".   We'd been standing 
right outside Miss <unk> door and as I went to turn the <unk> to <unk> I was surprised to find that the door was slightly <unk> 
But she seemed to be <unk> and in any case, we'd been talking in 
low <unk>   Her eyes opened as soon as she heard me, though, 
and once again, I felt an inward <unk> "I sure can't complain 
about the service in this <unk> she said. "I just got through seeing 
one of you <unk> What do <you> <unk> There was something 
almost <unk> in her tone, but I <unk> it.   "I've 
just been talking to Dr& <unk> I said. <unk> like 
you to have a <unk> and <unk> That's quite minor, nothing 
to worry about. But we would like your permission to do- that is, 
to go further if it proves <unk>   <unk> It was flat, <unk>   <unk> you let me <unk> Actually, I rather <unk> that we'll have to do this. Even if we do, you'll be out 
of here in a week, <unk>   I was sure that was the <unk> 
she just didn't want to stay here, where she couldn't get 
to the <unk>   <unk>   I looked at her in <unk> 
I'd had patients who'd refused <unk> before, of course, but 
never one who didn't show, in one way or another, the reason <unk> <unk> it was fear, but this woman's voice didn't <unk> and 
her hands were still on the <unk>   "Will you tell me <unk> 
I asked.   She smiled, a smile without humor. "You shouldn't 
tell your little secrets outside of the patient's <unk> 
she said. "I've got cancer, haven't <unk> She went on, <unk> 
my <unk> "I'm not going to be one of your <unk> <unk> 
Let your pupils learn on someone else, <unk> Just let me die in <unk> <unk> <unk> at her, almost <unk> Her little 
speech was totally out of character with the sort of person I thought 
she was. Even her voice had taken on a more cultivated tone. <unk> 
was someone who'd come down in the <unk> I thought. <A long, 
long way <unk> Again there was something familiar about her, <unk> 
**h   "You haven't got <unk> I said as strongly 
as I could. "I don't know what you heard that would make you 
think so, but I assure you I don't even know myself, so how can 
you be so <unk> And even <unk>   "Don't give me a lot 
of talk, <unk>   I <unk> at her. She could have found out 
my first name, of <unk> that wouldn't be difficult. But there 
was that something, some <unk> in the way she spoke **h   She was <unk> me <unk> a funny little <unk> on her lips. <unk> <unk> <unk> I've changed, haven't I? But you haven't 
changed much, <unk>   I knew then, knew with a <unk> <unk> <unk> I <unk> through dry lips. <unk> 
for goodness <unk>   <unk> she echoed <unk> "What's 
the matter, <unk> you scared of me? <unk> I'm going 
to make you introduce a drunk as your <unk> Well, don't <unk> Just 
let me <unk> <unk>   "But why did you come <unk> 
I'd found my voice. "Where have you been all these <unk> shrugged. <unk> and there. As for coming back <unk> 
well, I'll tell you the truth, I didn't even know where I was when 
I came to. The last thing I remember is a bar in San <unk> way she <unk> her flat acceptance of her <unk> <unk> 
made me <unk> And this was <unk> <unk>   "I 
never asked you for any <unk> <unk> she went on, "but I'm 
asking one now. Let me <unk> <unk> You doctors are all <unk> 
all you want is to cut up people and what's the <unk> No, I want 
out, <unk>   I looked at the <unk> <unk> of a woman before 
me. Let her out, let her out- that would be the <unk> wouldn't <unk> What she'd said was <unk> in all these years, she'd 
never asked for anything from me. If I let her go, she'd disappear 
once more. And <unk> would be <unk> was slowly swimming down to the bottom of the sea. She made 
me <unk> Her dark cool <unk> were <unk> than any <unk> 
the many little <unk> she knew made her embrace the ultimate one- 
the ever more fantastic pressures deeper in her body squeezed not me 
but the air I breathed into a nitrogen <unk> <unk> 
she <unk> me, and drew me deeper into <unk> no longer knew how deep I was, somewhere under <unk> feet, 
getting <unk> happier and more contented by the second. The reasons 
for this dive seemed foolish now. Only the dive itself had any meaning. 
The <unk> nitrogen made me wonder if I should remove 
the <unk> 
and <unk> in the sweet water. Perhaps if I took off the <unk> I could swim better, love my woman better. I <unk> <unk> 
and the <unk> fell out.   While a <unk> part of my mind <unk> on swimming down, a clear part <unk> over recent events, 
among them my only positive act in a long time. It was when I packed 
up what <unk> I had and went to Paris. It was no <unk> just me 
getting out after a <unk> I knew it wouldn't be the same. Wild <unk> never are, but I hoped to <unk> up a better frame of <unk> before I had been to Paris, long before I married <unk> 
That first time was good and it stuck with me. I was <unk> back 
then, in the army, and fog put our plane down at <unk> instead of <unk> It was a Saturday evening in April with a <unk> rain, 
and I was a little high on the good taste of life. I had a <unk> 
of money, which was unusual when I was in the army, and the plane 
would be grounded all night. In less than an hour I had gotten a <unk> <unk> shaved and was out on the <unk> <unk> in a fresh <unk> I felt like a <unk> in Rome.   All the women were <unk> 
and the men were equal to them; everything was glamorous to 
my <unk> eyes. There were some sweet machines other than <unk> 
an old <unk> a lean <unk> <unk> on an American <unk> a <unk> 
a type <unk> <unk> and lots more. There was the <unk> 
de <unk> and the <unk> <unk> I was no <unk> but I was <unk> and this was <unk>   I had champagne at <unk> 
then went into a cafe called the <unk> et <unk> to ask the way to <unk> 
I never got there. I met <unk> which was better. She was <unk> bread and <unk> just as fast as she possibly could, and washing 
it down with red <unk> I <unk> I didn't know a human could feed 
so fast and still be beautiful. She was <unk> and young, and nice 
and round in a tight white dress. Maybe her <unk> eating wasn't <unk> because she was so positive about it.   When she had <unk> the last of the bottle and paid her bill, she came directly 
to my table and said:   <unk> <unk> I have <unk> 
one hunger with food. I feel another of terrible <unk> Is your evening <unk>   <unk> I said with <unk> <unk> because 
of the <unk> <unk>   And so off we went 
to her apartment. She was a <unk> of course, the poor girl. <unk> 
the break of day I <unk> <unk> and drew <unk> about 
her way of eating bread and <unk>   Now it was nine years later, 
and it wasn't spring but winter when I <unk>   I got 
there on a Saturday evening. I made the mistake of going to the <unk> <unk> <unk> The place was busy but I didn't feel like a <unk> I 
sat waiting for Life to come along and sweep me up. I had part of a <unk> of French beer called <unk> <unk> <unk> help <unk> then switched 
to <unk> After a few hours, Life hadn't <unk> and I was <unk> 
I went to my hotel and <unk> The next morning a little <unk> 
made me feel <unk> but what can you do in Paris on Sunday <unk> 
So I drank more <unk>   All that day and Monday I <unk> just enough to orbit but not make deep space. I read the <unk> 
of <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> <unk> but sex. <unk> what was on my mind. I was turning over the idea of a good <unk> when I <unk> off.   I felt better Tuesday evening 
when I woke up. My head was clear, my thinking sober and I was <unk> 
to this Paris idea as a <unk> on top of all my others. A good <unk> has that kind of therapeutic value.   <unk> earlier 
the weather had turned cold and it was <unk> I went out into it. 
I walked around breathing the cold wine of the air until I found a <unk> 
and I sat down on a <unk> bench where the light was dim and came 
from the sky. There was dignity and beauty in the little white <unk> <unk> through the blue night. I had on only a <unk> but I wasn't <unk> I was just <unk>   <unk> soon a woman came along <unk> a folded <unk> as a walking <unk> She saw me and sat 
down beside me, three feet away. Suddenly I understood why she had 
the <unk> It gave her <unk> and <unk> Without it she would have 
been drab and <unk> It gave her <unk> It gave her the right 
to sit down beside me, back straight, one hand out on the <unk> I 
couldn't imagine her without it. I knew all about her. She was another 
human being and happened to be a <unk> I didn't much care if 
she were there or not.   After a while she said with sort of an <unk> <unk> "You have snow in your hair and <unk> (I didn't 
have on a <unk>   Hardly glancing at her, I smiled a <unk> 
one which said, <unk> baby, but I'd rather be alone.   She 
was silent for a while, then said, "Why are you so <unk> not <unk> I <unk> staring at the snow. She was 
trying to make a hole in my <unk> and I didn't want it. <unk> it a <unk> she asked <unk> She must have seen the ring 
on my left hand.   <unk> women and <unk> go <unk> 
I observed <unk> <unk> "You can <unk> your <unk> on <unk>   <unk> <unk> it is not my business to <unk> it 
**h"   This took me so funny I had to look at her. I felt my <unk> sad face <unk> and I grinned a silly one I couldn't have <unk> I even <unk> a <unk>   She smiled at me, but it 
was an <unk> sad smile. She was even more miserable than me. Her eyes 
were <unk> too, but so <unk> and there was <unk> and infinite <unk> in them. "Now isn't it better to <unk> she <unk> I liked this sad person so much, I said, "Will 
you have a drink with me"?   I could see the ancient <unk> <unk> itself in her eyes, and I wondered how many men she had picked 
up with this same <unk>   Anyway, I pulled a bottle of <unk> Martin out of my <unk> drew the <unk> and passed it to <unk> could see she was shocked.   "I'm sorry I haven't 
got a <unk> I said.   <unk> <unk> she said, taking the <unk> "not for that be <unk>   She tilted up and <unk> 
and then I <unk> It's really <unk> to drink good <unk> like 
that, but I hadn't cared before. I wasn't going to <unk> around a <unk>   There wasn't much light in the blue dark, but I could 
see her well. No child, this <unk> she must have been thirty-five or 
even <unk> I couldn't be sure. Somehow she was <unk> Not 
good <unk> but <unk> and wise so that it made her <unk> 
I liked her, and all at once I was glad she was there.   We <unk> the <unk> I hadn't had a lot out of it <unk> not <unk> much to each other, and we stayed <unk>   I suppose 
we were cold, but we didn't feel it. We seemed to be <unk> <unk> <unk> in the cold, cold air while the snow fell. Then she said, <unk> and we got up and went to my hotel without another <unk> sensed no stranger in her. We <unk> and made love with 
the comfortable acceptance I had once known with <unk> I decided <unk> was the best estimate of her age. She had a funny little <unk> on her stomach, on the left side.   I think we were very <unk> for we awoke at the same moment, deeply <unk> surprised to 
see the late morning sun on the windows, which were wet where the <unk> 
had <unk>   I felt wonderful, the absolute opposite of last night's <unk> My head was clear. I was hungry as a <unk> and 
my body felt lean and <unk>   <unk> <unk> I said <unk> 
sitting up, which pulled the covers to her <unk> She looked good, with 
her short <unk> hair and no <unk> Maybe closer to <unk> I <unk>   <unk> <unk> she <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> "Yeah, but breakfast <unk>   With a laugh she 
beat me to the bathroom. I called downstairs for food and a <unk> 
for her. She came out pink from a hot <unk> and I gave her my <unk> 
I had brushed my teeth, <unk> shaved and dressed by the time a <unk> wheeled in <unk>   "The <unk> <unk> he 
said, presenting it. I gave it to the woman.   "What is this <unk> she asked <unk>   "Why, to brush your <unk> I already <unk> I used <unk>   <unk> 
I said with round eyes. I wondered if I ought to go use the new 
one myself. But I smelled the coffee, and thinking, What the <unk> 
live <unk> I decided I would <unk> my worries away. The coffee 
wasn't very hot though, made in a <unk> <unk> but it was good. 
We sent the waiter away and ate a tremendous amount of cold <unk> hot <unk> eggs and hot <unk> bread. As we <unk> we <unk> Her name 
was <unk> and mine <unk>   We sat back comfortably on 
the bed with our last cups of coffee.   "You are very <unk> 
do you know, <unk> she <unk>   <unk> I <unk> <unk>   "Yes, because you didn't run off to use that 
new <unk>   I raised my eyes to look at her in the <unk> didn't really use <unk> she went on. "I carry 
one in my <unk> I know men never kiss <unk> <unk>   To 
my immense relief, she changed the subject in the next <unk> <unk> we go to the <unk> <unk>   "All right". I 
said with enthusiasm at the idea. "But not <unk> I put 
aside my empty <unk> She smiled all the way to her <unk> sad eyes, and <unk> her own.   We were not <unk>   "What is this <unk> I asked, touching the scar on her stomach. It was like a 
long thin line drawn through a pink circle.   "A <unk> she <unk> The <unk> was back in her eyes, a bitter wisdom, and I <unk> if forty were not so far wrong after all. She understood sex <unk> and played at it well.   We went to the <unk> for a 
few hours, then by <unk> to a <unk> in <unk>   It was 
a nice place, not filled with smoke. We had champagne and steamed <unk> 
The <unk> brought the wine first, a <unk> instead of 
the bottle I had ordered. He must have thought I was a <unk> fixed him with a <unk> eye and said, "What's this <unk> 
I didn't ask for a <unk> of <unk>   I thought that 
was pretty <unk> but I didn't <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> FOR <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> them in her bag. She would not stop to read them in American <unk> as many were doing, sitting on benches or leaning against the <unk> but pushed her way out into the street. This was her first 
day in Rome and it was June.   An enormous sky of the most delicate 
blue arched <unk> In her mind's <unk> her imagination responding <unk> almost <unk> to these <unk> peculiar powers 
of <unk> she saw the city as from above, <unk> on its 
great bare <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> here a <unk> 
there a <unk> and all around the low blue hills. <unk> in 
old Latin books returned to <unk> the <unk> Way Today, the <unk> 
the <unk> of <unk> She would see them, looking just as 
they had in the books, and this would make up a part of her <unk> <unk> nursing various <unk> her <unk> then her mother, 
then her <unk> through their lengthy <unk> <unk> could 
tell you the <unk> were always <unk> Theresa had had a chance 
to read quite a lot. England, France, Germany, <unk> and <unk> had all been rendered for her time and again, and between the <unk> hours of <unk> and <unk> she had conceived a <unk> passion 
by <unk> to see all these places with her own eyes. The very 
night after her father's funeral she had thought, though never admitted 
to a <unk> <unk> I can go. There's nothing to stop me <unk> 
So here it was, here was Italy, anyway, and terribly <unk> 
In the street the traffic was really <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
and <unk> all went <unk> at once down the narrow length 
of it or <unk> <unk> around a <unk> <unk> of tourists went 
by her in national <unk> English school girls in blue <unk> 
German boys with cameras <unk> <unk> dressed Americans looking 
in shop windows. <unk> to be alone, Theresa climbed the splendid outdoor <unk> that opened to her left. The Spanish <unk> <unk> special was going on here just now- the annual display of <unk> <unk> She had heard about it the night before at her hotel. 
It was not yet <unk> workmen were <unk> the <unk> plants 
from 
a truck and placing them in <unk> rows on the steps above. The <unk> 
were as large as <unk> and their myriad <unk> many still tight 
in the <unk> ranged in color from purple through <unk> and rose to 
the <unk> pink, along with many white ones too. <unk> thought <unk> climbing in her <unk> <unk> way, for she was someone 
who had learned that if you only move slowly enough you have time to 
notice everything. In Rome, all over Europe, she intended to move very 
slowly indeed.   <unk> up the <unk> she stopped and sat <unk> Other people were doing it, too, sitting all along the wide <unk> 
and leaning over the <unk> above, watching the <unk> mass, 
or just enjoying the sun. Theresa sat with her letters in her <unk> <unk> Mediterranean air. The sun warmed her, as it seemed to be <unk> everything, perhaps even the <unk> of <unk> or the chill <unk> of churches. She <unk> her <unk> jacket and smoked a cigarette. <unk> **h <unk> how could you be both at <unk> <unk> 
but she was. <unk> she picked up the first of the <unk> few moments later her hands were trembling and her <unk> had contracted 
with anxiety and <unk> <unk> course, one of them would have 
to go and do <unk> Poor Cousin <unk> she thought, tears rising 
to <unk> in the sun, <unk> why couldn't he have arranged to live 
through the <unk> And how on earth did I ever get this letter <unk> had reason indeed to wonder how the letter had 
managed to find her. Her Cousin Emma <unk> had written it, in her 
loose high old <unk> <unk> <unk> carefully <unk> but <unk> inclined to <unk> like an old car on the downward <unk> Cousin <unk> had simply put Miss Theresa <unk> Rome, Italy, 
on the <unk> had walked up to the post office in <unk> Alabama, 
and mailed it with as much confidence as if it had been a birthday <unk> to her <unk> <unk> No return address <unk> Somebody 
had <unk> American <unk> Piazza di <unk> across the <unk> and now Theresa had it, all as easily as if she had been

Two days before he was taken sick, Cousin <unk> was out <unk> about

always preserved in the top <unk> of his secretary a <unk> 
paper <unk> which Theresa had <unk> as a child and which he had promised 
she could have when he died. <unk> supposed to care as much now 
as then, as much here as <unk> she realized, with a <unk> <unk> letter 
would have got to me if she hadn't even put Rome, Italy, on <unk>   She <unk> the letter, replaced it in its <unk> 
and turned with relief to one from her brother <unk>   But <unk> <unk> when <he> had written, had only just returned from going 
to <unk> to Cousin <unk> <unk> He was full of heavy family <unk> All the fine old stock was dying out, look at the world

values which he and Theresa had always taken for granted, and as for 
his <unk> (he had one so far, still in <unk> he <unk> 
to think that the true meaning of character might never dawn on them 
at all. A life of <unk> and principle such as Cousin <unk> had lived 
had to be known at first hand **h.   Poor <unk> The only <unk> the family <unk> Together with her mother, both of them tense 
with worry lest things should somehow go wrong. Theresa had seen 
him through the right college, into the right <unk> and though <unk> by various girls and various <unk> of girls, safely married to 
the right sort, however much in the early years of that match his wife, <unk> had not seemed to understand poor <unk> Could it just be, <unk> <unk> that Anne had understood only too well, and that 
George all along was extraordinary only in the degree to which he was <unk>   As for Cousin Alexander <unk> the only thing <unk> could remember at the moment about him (except his paper <unk> 
was that he had had exceptionally long hands and feet and one night 
about one o'clock in the morning the whole <unk> family had 
been aroused to go next door at Cousin <unk> <unk> first Papa, 
then <unk> then Theresa and <unk> There they all did their <unk> to help Cousin <unk> get a <unk> out of his <unk> He had <unk> downstairs into the <unk> in his <unk> and was <unk> wrapped 
in his <unk> on a <unk> He held his long <unk> foot 
in both hands, and this and his <unk> <unk> he was trying <unk> 
not to cry out- made him look like a large <unk> old <unk> They 
all surrounded him, the family circle, Theresa and George as solemn 
as if they were watching the cat have <unk> and Cousin Emma <unk> back and forth with a <unk> of hot water which she poured <unk> 
into a white <unk> <unk> "Can you think of anything to do"? 
she kept <unk> "I hate to call the doctor but if this keeps 
up I'll just have <unk> Can you think of anything to do"? 
"You might treat it like the <unk> said <unk> <unk> a cold 
key down his <unk> "I just hope this happens to you <unk> 
said Cousin <unk> who was not at his best. <unk> Cousin <unk> 
George said. He was younger than <unk> she remembered looking 
down and seeing his great round eyes, while at the same time she was <unk> aware that her mother and father were not <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>   Now, here they both were, still the same, George 
full of <unk> <unk> and Cousin Emma in despair. Theresa shifted 
to a new <unk>   "Of course <unk> letter <unk> 
there are practical problems to be considered. Cousin Emma is alone 
in that big old house and won't hear to <unk> from it. <unk> 
and <unk> tried their best to persuade her to come and stay with them, 
and Anne and I have told her she's more than welcome here, but 
I think she feels that she might be an <unk> especially as long 
as our <unk> is still in high school. The other possibility is to 
make arrangements for her to let out one or two of the rooms to some teacher 
of good family or one of those solitary old ladies that <unk> 
is populated <unk> Miss <unk> <unk> for example. But there 
is more in this than meets the eye. A new <unk> would certainly 
have to be put in. The <unk> in the back bedroom is literally <unk> 
off **h". <unk> skipped a page of details about the <unk> 
"I hope if you have any ideas along these lines you will write 
me about them. I may settle on some makeshift arrangements for the summer 
and wait until you return in the fall so we can work out together 
the best **h".   I really shouldn't have smoked a cigarette 
so early in the day, thought <unk> it always makes me sick. I'll 
start <unk> in a minute, sitting on these cold steps. She got 
up, standing <unk> for a moment, then moving aside to let go past 
her, <unk> a group of young men. They wore shoes with pointed <unk> <unk> to American eyes, and narrow <unk> and their hair looked <unk> black and <unk> Yet here they were obviously thought to 
be handsome, and felt themselves to be so. Just then a man approached 
her with a tray of cheap <unk> Parker fountain <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> "No", said <unk> "No, <unk> she said. The 
man did not wish to leave. He knew how to spread himself against the <unk> of the space that had to separate them. <unk> rides in

away to <unk> and climbed to a higher landing where the steps <unk> in two. There she walked to the far left and leaned on a vacant 
section of <unk> while the <unk> picked himself another <unk> 
American lady, carrying a camera and a handsome <unk> bag, <unk> the steps alone. Was he ever successful, Theresa <unk> 
The lady with the <unk> bag registered interest, doubt, then <unk> 
at last, <unk> She cast about as though looking for a <unk> 
this really shouldn't be <unk> Finally, she <unk> 
away up the steps.   Theresa <unk> still holding the 
family letters in one hand, realized that her whole trip to Europe was <unk> in family circles as an <unk> between Cousin <unk> 
death and <unk> <unk> about Cousin <unk> They were even, <unk> and <unk> probably thinking themselves very <unk> in not <unk> that she really should cut out "one or two <unk> 
and come home in August to get Cousin <unk> house ready before the <unk> came to <unk> in <unk> Of course, it wasn't Anne 
and <unk> fault that one family crisis seemed to follow another, 
and weren't they always <unk> that they really didn't 
know what they would do without <unk> <The trouble <unk> Theresa <unk> <unk> while everything that happens there is supposed to

not care if all of Europe were to sink into the ocean tomorrow. It 
never registered with them that I had time to real all of <unk> <unk>

in the city library after <unk> operation. It would have been 
exactly the same to them if I had read through all <unk> volumes 
of <unk> <unk>   She arranged the letters <unk> one 
on top of the other. Then, with a motion so suddenly violent that she <unk> herself, she tore them in two.   <unk> became aware that two Italian <unk> carrying a large <unk> <unk> were standing before her and wanted her to move so that they could 
begin arranging a new row of the <unk>   <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> **h <unk> **h".   "Oh **h put it <unk> 
She indicated a spot a little distance away. <unk> knew it as surely as everybody in <unk> that Lucille 
was a husband <unk> You can't keep that kind of information quiet 
in a town of only <unk> And I've been told that just about 
every town, no matter what its size, has its Lucille <unk> as it has its Susan <unk> though <unk> ever bothered to 
tell me that. Susan <unk> that's me.   They even talked about <unk> down at the Young <unk> League where I spent 
a lot of time in Bible classes and helping out with the office work 
for our foreign mission. I never heard my folks talk about her, though. 
They were <unk> religious people, and I can <unk> say 
I never heard them spread any gossip about <unk> Even if they ever 
did say anything about people like Lucille Warren, I know they wouldn't 
have dreamed of saying it in front of me. My folks and my faith <unk> me from things like that.   And so I was really upset 
the first time I discovered that my boy friend Johnnie was seeing 
Mrs& <unk> 
I asked him about it one night while we were sitting 
in his truck. I asked him if it was true.   He gave me a straight, 
honest answer. <unk> <unk> <unk> he'd said. Much as I 
love <unk> well, a <unk> a guy and <unk> willing to- 
to come <unk> <unk> <unk> that's all it is- I don't even 
like Lucille much".   I guess it was at that moment that I 
realized what I was up against in the person of Lucille Warren. But 
it didn't seem fair. My love for Johnnie was young and <unk> 
how could I possibly compete with a woman like that, who didn't hesitate 
to use her sex.   Johnnie was a <unk> with a small lumber <unk> in a town about twenty miles away, and he was also pretty good 
at anything in the <unk> line. It was a <unk> sharp February 
morning that Johnnie first made his appearance in my back yard, bringing 
some stuff <unk> had ordered. I wasn't in the habit of batting 
my eyes at delivery men, but the moment I saw <unk> I knew he was <unk> He wasn't only <unk> he was <unk> He had an 
easy <unk> grace about him, the kind that kids don't have, but 
that I had sometimes admired in other older men. His smile was <unk> 
and his eyes held some promised secret that made my knees go <unk> most <unk> thing about the chance meeting was that <he> 
seemed interested in <unk> too. I could hardly believe such 
good luck was mine.   And now Lucille Warren had gotten a look 
at him. I guess she was between affairs or something, but anyway, she 
had set her sights on <unk> <unk> <unk>   I didn't 
like it one <unk> But what could I do? A man had to have his <unk> 
at least that's what the boys used to say in high <unk> and 
I wasn't providing it for <unk> Neither was his wife. She 
wouldn't have, even if he'd asked her.   But he wouldn't 
ask her- he wasn't the kind of man who would force his wife to submit 
to him against her will. And he wouldn't leave her <unk> he'd 
told me that. He was too honorable to leave his wife <unk> and 
leave those helpless children without their <unk>   Johnnie <unk> me and wanted me. But the only love <I> was giving him was the <unk> kind. It was weeks before we even kissed for the first time. <unk> my <unk> <unk> we'd been seeing each other for short rides in the truck. 
The rides were <unk> <unk> mostly we <unk> But by the time the 
first <unk> of spring came around, we both knew we were hopelessly 
in love. Yet even then we did nothing much but talk, and maybe neck 
a little.   "It's so <unk> I told him once. "I always <unk> I would probably end up <unk> a minister or somebody like 
that. Somebody with no <unk> <unk> know".   "And you 
fall for a lumber <unk>   "Who drinks far too <unk> <unk> too much".   <unk> I was <unk> off 
the items on my fingers, <unk> too much and goes out with the boys, <unk> <unk> are, too much, and who <never> goes to church 
and won't even listen when I try to persuade him to come back to the <unk>   He examined his nails carefully. "I could walk 
out the <unk>   "Don't you <unk>   "And never 
show my face or my truck around here again". He still wasn't looking 
at me.   "You <unk>   <unk> I could visit <unk> <unk>   "You <unk> <unk> You <unk> shrugged <unk> "I <unk>   And 
now he <was> seeing her. He'd just admitted it to me. I huddled <unk> beside him in the truck. It was all <unk> <unk> his 
seeing her. Johnnie and I had been innocent in our love, and that was 
the way I wanted to keep it. At first, Johnnie hadn't <unk> 
how could he, not being a religious person like me? But then 
he had said, "All right, <unk> if that's how you want it, that's 
how it'll <unk>   But what had I done, trying to keep us <unk> 
I had driven him into the arms of that <unk> woman. I had just 
the same as delivered him into the hands of the <unk>   So 
one week later, I surrendered to him in the little motel on Route <unk> My very first time. I was desperate to hold him, to give him whatever 
in this world he wanted or needed, and to keep him from the <unk> 
of Lucille Warren.   And, though at the time I <unk> 
to admit it even to myself, there was in me a growing <unk> a sexual <unk> that Johnnie had set in motion, an awareness that no other 
man had ever <unk> I wanted him, with a <unk> <unk> enough, it was my own voice I heard there in the <unk> begging this man to make love to me.   <unk> me, <unk>   "I will, <unk>   <unk> in the <unk> <unk> behind the <unk> a thousand <unk> <unk> us. "Will 
you always love me this <unk>   <unk> <unk> <unk> And I <unk> closer to the man <unk> loved. 
It was as <unk> and <unk> a night as any bride ever <unk> 
I had had no wedding <unk> no <unk> no <unk> of marriage, 
but I had all the joy that goes with them.   <unk> <unk>   "It can't be wrong, can it? Not <unk> rose on one <unk> <unk> <unk> It's never wrong 
if love is <unk>   I took great comfort from his words, 
and smiled to myself in the darkness. <unk> peace, complete <unk> <unk> <unk> I later <unk> <unk> felt no conflict 
between what I was doing and my strict religious <unk> I had 
always resisted the passes made at me by other <unk> and many times 
I had thought about my love for Johnnie who, being <unk> brought a <unk> to love that the kids around town could know nothing about. 
I had also thought a lot about how God must look on true love, and so 
in a way I was keeping my promise to God, my promise to remain pure 
until I was married.   I <was> practically a bride, after <unk> <unk> have been a ceremony if it had been possible. 
Of this, I had no <unk> <unk> Johnnie do practically anything 
in the world to insure my <unk> Of course he would. He'd 
not only told me so, he'd proved it. It wasn't <unk> fault 
that he was hopelessly tied down to that <unk> woman who did 
her best to make his life <unk> Just because he was honorable 
enough to want to continue supporting his two children, as any decent 
man would, that was no reason he should be denied his own small share 
of happiness too. And if I could contribute to that, I'd do it. The 
cost didn't matter. No price is too high when true love is at <unk> I had no doubts about how true this love was. I'd 
never even <unk> with a boy, and after I met Johnnie he never touched 
me for the <unk> while, not until I all but threw myself at him. 
He was plenty <unk> all right, but he behaved like a gentleman, 
and I figured that, <unk> I was closer to his age than to 
my own eighteen and a half. What could a mere twelve years <unk> 
It <unk> I was sure, a difference in age that came between people, 
but a difference in <unk>   And hadn't I rescued him from <unk> <unk> She'd have gotten him, if I hadn't stopped 
her. After all, Lucille Warren <was> a <unk> from way 
back.   But <unk> been a good girl and now God was blessing 
me with the gift of this magnificent man and the <unk> love we <unk> It was only fitting that we seek out whatever joy our union might <unk>   <unk> <unk>   <unk> Love <unk> and always, <unk>   <unk>   <unk> time in Boston. 
A chill wind in the air and the narrow streets packed with snow. From 
the entire eastern half of the nation they'd be coming, members 
of the Young <unk> League, and I'd been chosen to represent 
our <unk>   I had mixed emotions about going. I'd been 
seeing Johnnie almost a year now, but I still didn't want to leave 
him for five whole days. But I had looked forward so much to being 
with this church group. I hadn't been doing as much work as I used 
to in <unk> and I felt funny about that and wanted to work harder 
than ever. I wanted to just throw myself into the good works of this <unk> group. So I went to Boston.   The first meeting was 
held in <unk> Hall, a great big place where we were able to meet members 
from all the other states. My cousin <unk> at whose home I was <unk> during the convention, introduced me to a group of young people 
from Rhode Island. One of them was a very friendly, lovely fellow <unk> <unk> a boy about my age with <unk> blond hair and dancing 
blue eyes. He looked very different from <unk> in fact, he looked 
sort of like me. I thought so, and he mentioned it, and <unk> said 
so too.   After the meeting, there was going to be a party at <unk> house. I assumed <unk> would get me there, but in the confusion 
of the meeting breaking up, we were <unk> Outside the hall, 
I anxiously looked around for her, then all at once there was a 
hand on my <unk>   "Hey, there, beautiful twin of <unk> <unk> 
said. <unk> a <unk> to get to the <unk>   I couldn't 
help laughing with him. "Well, I <unk> find <unk> 
I began.   <unk> <unk> Come along with me". I went. <unk> the time we <unk> the party was already going strong. 
A couple of the girls were laughing rather <unk> and I realized 
they were <unk> My folks wouldn't dream of having alcohol in the 
house, so my first taste 
of it had <unk> of <unk> with <unk> 
I hadn't liked it at <unk> it was bitter and <unk> But when <unk> disguised the taste with <unk> <unk> I enjoyed it. Of course 
I enjoyed <unk> anything if I did it with <unk> Johnnie 
**h I suddenly realized he'd been totally out of my thoughts all evening. 
But that was only natural, I <unk> surely he was still resting <unk> in my heart.   "I don't see <unk> <unk> 
I said.   "She's <unk> tonight. <unk> let's find 
out where they're keeping the <unk>   I drew back. <unk> 
I don't think so, <unk> Not for me".   <unk> come <unk>   <unk> <unk>   He shrugged. <unk> But 
at least come along while <I> get <unk>   The kitchen 
was <unk> <unk> <unk> most of them, and I wasn't even sure 
all of them had come from the League meeting. <unk> normal circumstances, he had a certain <unk> <unk> <unk> 
with great appeal for young <unk> old <unk> and dogs. <unk> he looked like an <unk> who had left his <unk> <unk> on 
the bureau and spent six months in <unk> hollow eyes, hollow cheeks, <unk> stomach. <unk> he thought. A shot of orange juice would 
make everything seem better. He looked around his little <unk> <unk> bed, table, chair, <unk> stove. Then he <unk> share a <unk> Mrs& <unk> had said, and <unk> 
at <unk> after the long drive from New York in <unk> rain, 
that had sounded reasonable. In the cold light of day, it seemed a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> but share <unk> She 
had explained it- something about summer people's eating out and 
not enough space in the units. And where was the <unk> He remembered 
seeing it last night, when he put away his small store of <unk> <unk> Ah, <unk> his half of a refrigerator stood outside, 
on the <unk> <unk> between Unit <unk> Three and Unit <unk> <unk>   It was still <unk> and Mrs& <unk> <unk> <unk> through the gray <unk> like the names they <unk> vivid blue 
and green and <unk> Charlie <unk> his orange juice and one of 
the long, <unk> green <unk> his spirits as damp as the day.   This 
vacation had seemed like a good idea last week, when his doctor had <unk> it. "Take a full <unk> the doctor had said. <unk> 
of sun, lots of rest. The red <unk> are a <unk> <unk> 
This is a sleeping <unk> The others will make you a little more <unk> until you get it <unk> You young men get to be my age, 
you won't take flu so <unk>   Charlie had accepted the <unk> without <unk> The doctor could call it anything from flu 
to <unk> but Charlie knew what was wrong with him and knew, 
too, that there was no <unk> to cure it. He had loved and lost Vivian <unk> to somebody else, had watched her marry the somebody else, and 
had caught a bear of a cold by <unk> the bride <unk> <unk> which 
was really piling it on. He had <unk> too, like an <unk> a confirmed <unk> of women. Once <unk> <unk> really, because Vivian 
had given him every <unk> forever <unk> From now on, 
his was going to be a man's world: the North <unk> <unk> <unk> 
at <unk> beer and <unk> and male <unk>   Meanwhile, he 
had this miserable cold, and as he leaned against the refrigerator, watching 
the rain make <unk> <unk> at his feet, the doctor's <unk> 
for lots of sun seemed like a hollow <unk> In these damp circumstances, 
he was an <unk> bet to develop <unk>   He looked 
up to see Mrs& <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk> bearing down on him. <unk> <unk> she bellowed <unk> He had noticed before that the natives seemed to regard 
really filthy weather as a kind of <unk> victory over the <unk> <unk> day after <unk> she added.   "I hope <unk> 
he said. "I've got this cold. <unk> I'd <unk> it out in 
the <unk>   <unk> She studied him <unk> <unk> got 
a <unk> look. Better get in out of the <unk>   Charlie <unk> 
to mention that the wet was somewhat <unk> <unk> being less 
than <unk> As for its being fine, day after tomorrow, he had 
the unhappy conviction that it would never be fine again, with Vivian 
lost to him forever. He could imagine her at this minute, <unk> 
in Nassau with <unk> <unk> on golden <unk> looking 
forward to a life of <unk> <unk> All Charlie could look forward 
to was a yellow <unk> at noon, a <unk> sandwich for <unk> and a <unk> old <unk> if he lived that long.   He <unk> through the 
light reading provided by Mrs& <unk> for her <unk> four separate <unk> of the <unk> Twins <unk> the <unk> At the Mountains, 
On the <unk> and <unk> <unk> and several agricultural <unk> 
on the treatment of <unk> disease in cattle, <unk> <unk> He <unk> only to dream of <unk> and <unk> only to <unk> into the night table, <unk> his other <unk> He took a yellow <unk> only to choke on it, and went for the <unk> only to find something <unk> in the <unk> something pink and <unk> 
His first thought was that Mrs& <unk> in her <unk> for color, had <unk> a cat and that cat had somehow managed to open the refrigerator 
door and climb <unk> but on further <unk> the thing proved to 
be a <unk> of the <unk> variety that <unk> onto men's <unk> <unk> pale pink and, according to the <unk> size <unk> He 
thought about it for a minute, could find no reasonable explanation 
for the presence of a sweater in the refrigerator, got the <unk> bread, 
and a Bermuda <unk> and put the whole thing out of his mind. ## <unk> morning, he found a note in the <unk> "Would you 
mind <unk> your <unk> said this <unk> "The smell <unk> <unk> Everything being the <unk> a <unk> case, and 
a <unk> bottle of <unk> <unk> pink hand <unk> The note paper 
was pink, too, and the <unk> small and <unk> and utterly <unk>

female reason, she kept her clothes in the refrigerator, they would 
not be <unk> They would be black or white or <unk> <unk> chic

This weekend, he thought, he would look around for some more subdued <unk> with Cape <unk> <unk> at the door. He could not imagine 
a <unk> being brave enough to grow beside <unk> <unk> and 
the rest.   The sweater was gone from the refrigerator, and in 
its place was a large plastic bag, full of wet pink clothes. No wonder 
she was so pale, wearing all those cold clothes.   He got a 
red <unk> and a beer and then, on <unk> transferred the rest of his <unk> to her side of the refrigerator and <unk> <unk> my <unk> 
on the <unk> It gave him a good feeling.   <unk> <unk> 
was her answer the next day. The note was <unk> against his <unk> bottles and bore a <unk> "You're not at all well, are <unk>   "I've got this <unk> he <unk> Not that it

on the beach, looking for a pale, <unk> girl in a pink bathing <unk> There were pink bathing suits on <unk> and <unk>
